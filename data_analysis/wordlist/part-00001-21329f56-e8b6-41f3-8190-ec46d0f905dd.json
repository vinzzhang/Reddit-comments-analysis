{"author":"bonoboTP","body":"This leads me to think that it's better to use pseudonyms on the internet instead of always putting your real identity out there. There are some very determined harassing and bullying people online and I've seen some very nasty cases (rather famous ones). It can involve stalking and spreading rumors, trying to intentionally harm one's credibility for the \"fun\" of it (some people are really weird).\n\nI also started to think about what I would do if really many people knew me. There will always be plenty of extremes on the negative side and maybe the positive people just don't interact with you as much so the net result looks more negative to you than it really is.\n\nTaking this to an extreme, what if millions of people know you (e.g. politicians, musicians...). How can you assess your reputation then? How can you have an outside objective point of view about yourself and whether your approach is working? If you filter people based on their opinions, you will still have hundreds of thousands of people who \"by filtering\" agree with anything you say in particular. So you can't just filter like that. Probably any filter is good that is uncorrelated to the sentiment of the opinion. It may be based on physical proximity, random choice, whatever. I wonder if high-profile politicians (like prime ministers or presidents) have a solution to this. Basically anyone they meet knows who they are and may have a hidden agenda (bias on the positive side to get a promotion or corruption money; or bias on the negative by trying to bring you down). Probably this is why they tend to put family and trusted old friends to high positions (besides the obvious corrupt politician trope).\n\nBut I guess you already thought much more about this, given your extensive posts on LessWrong about statistical biases and \"thinkos\".","word_list":"this leads me to think that it s better to use pseudonyms on the internet instead of always putting your real identity out there  there are some very determined harassing and bullying people online and i ve seen some very nasty cases  rather famous ones   it can involve stalking and spreading rumors  trying to intentionally harm one s credibility for the  fun  of it  some people are really weird  \n\ni also started to think about what i would do if really many people knew me  there will always be plenty of extremes on the negative side and maybe the positive people just don t interact with you as much so the net result looks more negative to you than it really is \n\ntaking this to an extreme  what if millions of people know you  e g  politicians  musicians      how can you assess your reputation then  how can you have an outside objective point of view about yourself and whether your approach is working  if you filter people based on their opinions  you will still have hundreds of thousands of people who  by filtering  agree with anything you say in particular  so you can t just filter like that  probably any filter is good that is uncorrelated to the sentiment of the opinion  it may be based on physical proximity  random choice  whatever  i wonder if high profile politicians  like prime ministers or presidents  have a solution to this  basically anyone they meet knows who they are and may have a hidden agenda  bias on the positive side to get a promotion or corruption money  or bias on the negative by trying to bring you down   probably this is why they tend to put family and trusted old friends to high positions  besides the obvious corrupt politician trope  \n\nbut i guess you already thought much more about this  given your extensive posts on lesswrong about statistical biases and  thinkos  "}

{"author":"st0rmyc","body":"/r/sharepoint might be able to help. I don't think it would be terribly hard, but probably time consuming.\n\nI'm going to assume you already know how to make a webpart. So, you'd probably have to cache the comic image and possibly the link to the original source. And by caching, that could either be creating a service that downloads the new comic on a daily basis and perhaps loads it to a picture library or something (loading it on the fly from xkcd's site wouldn't be good for anyone).\n\nNot sure how you would introduce the interactive comics though.

{"author":"XMorbius","body":"&gt; I'm can't say I've heard of a female version of friend zoning.\n\nThe term describes any instance where one party desires a relationship beyond friendship, with the other rejecting them by offering to be friends.  As such it's gender-neutral.  Now, it may seem gendered because the assumption in US society (and others) is that women are asked out by men.  This means men are the ones who bring it up the most - it's most relevant to them.  If the roles were reversed (or ideally, if there was no assumption on who was asking out whom) the term would almost certainly seem less gendered.\n\nUnrequited love is a frustration all genders share, and all of them can have good and bad reactions to it.  But humor can end up submitting to trends, and that's what happened here - the trend of calling out so-called nice guys made it into the comic.

{"author":"xthorgoldx","body":"The thing about smartwatches is that, even though they're kinda gimmicky, they *are* a huge convenience, especially models with touchscreens that essentially using your phone as a distributed processing server.\n\nI keep my phone in my pocket sometimes, but more often it's in my backpack - especially when I'm traveling or working out. Add my chronic situational blindness and a lot of the time I can't feel/hear it ring, and by the time I fish it out I can't answer. Alternatively, it's always awkward to pull out a phone in the middle of a conversation to read a new text, even if you're waiting for a fairly important communication.\n\nI have a Pebble, which is pretty much the bare minimum of what I'd consider a smartwatch nowadays, and it's hella convenient. I can check my texts with a glance, ensuring that I can pay attention to the people around me while still being aware of people trying to get in contact. I'll never miss a call again (intentionally) because the vibration is now on my *wrist.* I can check the weather, check the time, check the date, all with a glance instead of having to fish a phone out of my pocket.\n\nTouchscreen watches are even better, because they allow for more utility and functionality. Microphone and speaker capacity? All the functionality of a phone with none of the bulk. \n\nIt's like Bluetooth headsets were a while back - they were incredibly functional for those that used them, but they had the problem of being socially stigmatized. Watches, however, don't carry that connotation, even if they're visibly smartwatches, because, well, we're used to watches.

When my friend told me there was a fan fiction of an XKCD hate-blog, I thought I'd check it out for a laugh.\n\nNaturally, Randall is depicted as the villain here. The hero is a guy named Rob, (further investigation tells me he is the guy who used to run the original Xkcdsucks blog) who is super-fat and in love with Randall's wife.\n\nIt's worse than you're imagining. Seriously, this whole story is wrong in so many ways. There's a cancer joke in the first chapter, and it just gets worse from there. I honestly think the constant fat jokes are the *least* offensive thing about this fic.\n\nDon't believe me? This is what chapter 2 looks like:\n\n&gt; As if on cue, a timer buzzed in the ceiling.\n&gt; “Ooh, milk time!” Randall squealed in excitement. He dived in and waded through the coloured balls to sit on Megan’s lap, and latched on to her.\n&gt; Megan gently rubbed Randall’s back and ran her fingers through his hair while he suckled, for thirty rapturous minutes. Though she was sure he’d had enough, Randall asked for more, and continued to feed until Megan had no milk left to give him.\n\nThe weird thing is, besides all the batshit, it's actually quite well written*. The cover design is kind of neat. And I like the way each chapter appears to be named after an XKCD comic.\n\n*Except for the use of random song lyrics as chapter epigraphs.

{"author":"itty53","body":"As personal as a 'thanks' can get, which is to say not very. I don't stay pen-pals or anything, and typically don't reply to theirs unless they have questions in return (very rare). It's never just 'thanks -B' or something, it's usually 'Thanks for the kind words. It's important to keep learning and developing and yada yada...' and 'Thanks again, -...'. \n\nThere's no real 'personal' way to say thank you, other than a gift or something. I feel like if I were to get a gift from someone just for thanking *them* or asking a question, that'd be a little weird. I did feel a little emboldened recently by Auerbach, whom I mentioned earlier, albeit it was a kind of ironic emboldening. I was thanking him for approaching the '4chan/troll' situation as a true moderate - he didn't condemn the 4chan user base, but rather said '*if* you're going to condemn someone, and I'm not sure we should yet, then condemn the guy who owns the site.' Really, [that article](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/09/the_fappening_ebola_chan_revenge_porn_why_isn_t_4chan_s_founder_accountable.html) cuts straight through the troll bullshit. I'd recommend it. \n\nAnyway, I explained why the article stuck out to me and what I got from it, and it was like I said, a brilliant maneuvering through a troll-mine-field. It's bold to call out 4chan as a columnist like that, and he did it flawlessly. In his reply he said:\n\n&gt;..thanks for reassuring me that my point didn't get completely lost in the noise. I hope the reasonable people can win out.\n\nAnd that made me feel good. You know those times when you see a guy on TV or something and think, 'I bet he and I would get along well'? That's how I felt about Auerbach when I clicked 'send'. So his reply was kinda neat in that regard.

{"author":"therant","body":"I've heard of OnLive before. I had forgotten what it was called, but they're what I was referring to in the original post.\n\nIndeed, latency issues were basically its downfall. I realize that what I'm thinking isn't feasible in the near future, but 5-10 years down the line it's totally achievable. Look at how 4G networks are being implemented worldwide and the 5G advancements being made in Asia. \n\nWhat I'm envisioning (and again, I'm not a visionary by far. I'm just a guy who loves computers but has no connection to the IT field whatsoever.) is more of an OS which is cloud-integrated.\n\nYour devices basically receive a \"remote connection\" to a virtual machine which runs everything (processing power, graphics, apps etc.) and delivers the graphical output to your device. Think of it as portable monitors/screens that connect to the same computer. Once wireless Internet connections become fast and reliable enough (which is soon to be a reality) it will be the most practical way to do things.\n\nI think it's kind of cumbersome to carry so many independent computers around. I usually carry my smartphone, my tablet and laptop computer to work every day. At home I have other independent devices (e-readers, smart TV, gaming consoles etc.) It's cumbersome to save something on your laptop and then working with a cloud-based storage solution to access it from my tablet. It's weird to have different apps on my Android devices when it's possible to have a way of an OS knowing what apps you have installed on your other devices and synchronize between them.\n\nWith my idea, you basically have one single computer with everything on it and you access it from multiple devices. It's all the same OS, it's all the same apps, everything is in one place (the virtual machine) and on all devices at once. No need to sync between devices, no need to move or share files for yourself. You have one computer with multiple displays. Ones you keep on you while on the go. Others to keep at home. You will basically have to purchase something like a \"performance plan\" where you get a subscription for processor power, memory, graphic capabilities of the central (virtual) machine, and then just stream whatever it does to your devices. Thus, your devices will require minimum processing power, meaning that they require less power and less updates all while performing as good as the virtual machine they connect to.\n\nI don't know if I'm explaining right, but I haven't heard of anyone planning for something similar as of yet.","word_list":"i ve heard of onlive before  i had forgotten what it was called  but they re what i was referring to in the original post \n\nindeed  latency issues were basically its downfall  i realize that what i m thinking isn t feasible in the near future  but     years down the line it s totally achievable  look at how  g networks are being implemented worldwide and the  g advancements being made in asia  \n\nwhat i m envisioning  and again  i m not a visionary by far  i m just a guy who loves computers but has no connection to the it field whatsoever   is more of an os which is cloud integrated \n\nyour devices basically receive a  remote connection  to a virtual machine which runs everything  processing power  graphics  apps etc   and delivers the graphical output to your device  think of it as portable monitors screens that connect to the same computer  once wireless internet connections become fast and reliable enough  which is soon to be a reality  it will be the most practical way to do things \n\ni think it s kind of cumbersome to carry so many independent computers around  i usually carry my smartphone  my tablet and laptop computer to work every day  at home i have other independent devices  e readers  smart tv  gaming consoles etc   it s cumbersome to save something on your laptop and then working with a cloud based storage solution to access it from my tablet  it s weird to have different apps on my android devices when it s possible to have a way of an os knowing what apps you have installed on your other devices and synchronize between them \n\nwith my idea  you basically have one single computer with everything on it and you access it from multiple devices  it s all the same os  it s all the same apps  everything is in one place  the virtual machine  and on all devices at once  no need to sync between devices  no need to move or share files for yourself  you have one computer with multiple displays  ones you keep on you while on the go  others to keep at home  you will basically have to purchase something like a  performance plan  where you get a subscription for processor power  memory  graphic capabilities of the central  virtual  machine  and then just stream whatever it does to your devices  thus  your devices will require minimum processing power  meaning that they require less power and less updates all while performing as good as the virtual machine they connect to \n\ni don t know if i m explaining right  but i haven t heard of anyone planning for something similar as of yet "}

First, it is extremely brightly colored, very beautiful looking animal. Second, it has more color-sensing cells in it's eyes than any other animal. Dogs can see two colors, humans can see three, mantis shrimp can see 16. \n\nThe most interesting property, though, is it's hunting technique. The Mantis shrimp has two limbs that are club shaped, and it uses them to punch other animals to death. That in itself is interesting, but the animal's main food source is shellfish, this small animal can punch through the hardest shells. How? By moving *faster than the speed of sound*. The shrimp punches so fast, that the sudden increase in pressure causes the water around the club to brightly flash in a little-understood phenomenon called sonoluminescence. \n\nAnyway, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXrxCT0NpHo) is the video I was watching on them, in which Destin from Smarter Every Day travels to James Cook University with his slow-motion equipment to test a theory about how it punches that fast, and then analysing the chemical makeup of the clubs themselves that allows them not to shatter when shells do. .

So each word now can be capitalized or not. With four words, that's 2^4 (16x) multiplier on top of our 8x.\n\nWhat if people, like in the comic, use spaces? Or maybe hyphens? Underscores? That's 4 options (including no spaces), so multiply search space by 4x. Wait, what if they use combinations thereof? Make that 64x, my bad. (4 combinations to the power of three between-word separations)\n\nI've already increased the search space by over 8000x once you combine all the above factors. Suddenly, 1.25 hours becomes over a year. And we haven't even touched punctuation yet.\n\nIf we have 2000 words, that's 2000^4 original search space, plus our multipliers = 64 billion possibilities. Now, I'm not saying it's impossible. oclHashCat can run some algorithms at nearly 200 million hashes a second on a good graphics card even on SHA512, making a year for this code, to oclHashCat probably figuring it out in a few minutes. I'm just saying that it's not as simple as this trivial 'crack' seems to make it.\n","word_list":"yes  and anyone knows how permutations work  these little simple definitions add up fast \n\nlet s play  what if  and make some assumptions here \n\nwe ll get maybe an average of   different number replacements of words  search space quadruples \n\nlet s assume every word has an average of   misspelling  search space doubles  and don t forget  these multiply by each other  so we re at  x already \n\npeople frequently capitalize words  and let s just assume we ll only capitalize the first letter  so each word now can be capitalized or not  with four words  that s       x  multiplier on top of our  x \n\nwhat if people  like in the comic  use spaces  or maybe hyphens  underscores  that s   options  including no spaces   so multiply search space by  x  wait  what if they use combinations thereof  make that  x  my bad     combinations to the power of three between word separations \n\ni ve already increased the search space by over  x once you combine all the above factors  suddenly      hours becomes over a year  and we haven t even touched punctuation yet \n\nif we have   words  that s     original search space  plus our multipliers     billion possibilities  now  i m not saying it s impossible  oclhashcat can run some algorithms at nearly   million hashes a second on a good graphics card even on sha   making a year for this code  to oclhashcat probably figuring it out in a few minutes  i m just saying that it s not as simple as this trivial  crack  seems to make it \n"}

{"author":"TexasJefferson","body":"\"Timeless decision theory\" The idea is that, given a lot of constraints, it's possible for two sufficiently rational agents, with sufficient knowledge of one another, to cooperate in spite of not being able to causally effect one another (for instance, if they exist at different times or very far away from each other). The (argued) viability of acausal trade is an unintuitive idea and not a part of current mainstream decision theory.\n\nHere's LW's wiki's example:\n\n&gt;In Newcomb's problem, a superintelligent artificial intelligence, Omega, presents you with a transparent box and an opaque box. The transparent box contains $1000 while the opaque box contains either $1,000,000 or nothing. You are given the choice to either take both boxes (called two-boxing) or just the opaque box (one-boxing). However, things are complicated by the fact that Omega is an almost perfect predictor of human behavior and has filled the opaque box as follows: if Omega predicted that you would one-box, it filled the box with $1,000,000 whereas if Omega predicted that you would two-box it filled it with nothing.\n\n&gt;Many people find it intuitive that it is rational to two-box in this case. As the opaque box is already filled, you cannot influence its contents with your decision so you may as well take both boxes and gain the extra $1000 from the transparent box. CDT formalizes this style of reasoning. However, one-boxers win in this scenario. After all, if you one-box then Omega (almost certainly) predicted that you would do so and hence filled the opaque box with $1,000,000. So you will almost certainly end up with $1,000,000 if you one-box. On the other hand, if you two-box, Omega (almost certainly) predicted this and so left the opaque box empty . So you will almost certainly end up with $1000 (from the transparent box) if you two-box. Consequently, if rationality is about winning then it's rational to one-box in Newcomb's problem (and hence CDT fails to be an adequate decision theory).\n\n&gt;TDT will endorse one-boxing in this scenario and hence endorses the winning decision. When Omega predicts your behavior, it carries out the same abstract computation as you do when you decide whether to one-box or two-box. To make this point clear, we can imagine that Omega makes this prediction by creating a simulation of you and observing its behavior in Newcomb's problem. This simulation will clearly decide according to the same abstract computation as you do as both you and it decide in the same manner. Now given that TDT says to act as if deciding the output of this computation, it tells you to act as if your decision to one-box can determine the behavior of the simulation (or, more generally, Omega's prediction) and hence the filling of the boxes. So TDT correctly endorses one-boxing in Newcomb's problem as it tells the agent to act as if doing so will lead them to get $1,000,000 instead of $1,000.","word_list":" timeless decision theory  the idea is that  given a lot of constraints  it s possible for two sufficiently rational agents  with sufficient knowledge of one another  to cooperate in spite of not being able to causally effect one another  for instance  if they exist at different times or very far away from each other   the  argued  viability of acausal trade is an unintuitive idea and not a part of current mainstream decision theory \n\nhere s lw s wiki s example \n\n gt in newcomb s problem  a superintelligent artificial intelligence  omega  presents you with a transparent box and an opaque box  the transparent box contains    while the opaque box contains either        or nothing  you are given the choice to either take both boxes  called two boxing  or just the opaque box  one boxing   however  things are complicated by the fact that omega is an almost perfect predictor of human behavior and has filled the opaque box as follows  if omega predicted that you would one box  it filled the box with        whereas if omega predicted that you would two box it filled it with nothing \n\n gt many people find it intuitive that it is rational to two box in this case  as the opaque box is already filled  you cannot influence its contents with your decision so you may as well take both boxes and gain the extra    from the transparent box  cdt formalizes this style of reasoning  however  one boxers win in this scenario  after all  if you one box then omega  almost certainly  predicted that you would do so and hence filled the opaque box with         so you will almost certainly end up with        if you one box  on the other hand  if you two box  omega  almost certainly  predicted this and so left the opaque box empty   so you will almost certainly end up with     from the transparent box  if you two box  consequently  if rationality is about winning then it s rational to one box in newcomb s problem  and hence cdt fails to be an adequate decision theory  \n\n gt tdt will endorse one boxing in this scenario and hence endorses the winning decision  when omega predicts your behavior  it carries out the same abstract computation as you do when you decide whether to one box or two box  to make this point clear  we can imagine that omega makes this prediction by creating a simulation of you and observing its behavior in newcomb s problem  this simulation will clearly decide according to the same abstract computation as you do as both you and it decide in the same manner  now given that tdt says to act as if deciding the output of this computation  it tells you to act as if your decision to one box can determine the behavior of the simulation  or  more generally  omega s prediction  and hence the filling of the boxes  so tdt correctly endorses one boxing in newcomb s problem as it tells the agent to act as if doing so will lead them to get        instead of      "}
{"author":"shagieIsMe","body":"You might want to glance at Singularity Sky by Charles Stross.  From the first bit of the Wikipedia summary of the background:\n\n&gt; Singularity Sky takes place roughly in the early 23rd century, around 150 years after an event referred to by the characters as the Singularity. Shortly after the Earth's population topped 10 billion, computing technology began reaching the point where artificial intelligence could exceed that of humans through the use of closed timelike curves to send information to its past. Suddenly, one day, 90% of the population inexplicably disappeared.\n\n&gt; Messages left behind, both on computer networks and in monuments placed on the Earth and other planets of the inner solar system carry a short statement from the apparent perpetrator of this event:\n\n&gt; &gt; I am the Eschaton; I am not your God.\n&gt; &gt; I am descended from you, and exist in your future.\n&gt; &gt; Thou shalt not violate causality within my historic light cone. Or else.\n\n&gt; Earth collapses politically and economically in the wake of this population crash; the Internet Engineering Task Force eventually assumes the mantle of the United Nations, or at least its altruistic mission and charitable functions. Anarchism replaces nation-states; in the novel the UN is described as having 900 of the planet's 15,000 polities as members, and its membership is not limited to polities.\n\n&gt; A century later, the first interstellar missions, using quantum tunnelling-based jump drives to provide effective faster-than-light travel without violating causality, are launched. One that reaches Barnard's Star finds what happened to those who disappeared from Earth: they were sent to colonise other planets via wormholes that took them back one year in time for every light-year (ly) the star was from Earth. Gradually, it is learned, these colonies were scattered across a 6,000-ly area of the galaxy, all with the same message from the Eschaton etched onto a prominent monument somewhere. There is also evidence that the Eschaton has enforced the \"or else\" through drastic measures, such as inducing supernovae or impact events on the civilization that attempted to create causality-violating technology.\n\nVery little deals with Eschaton itself... though it touches on it at times.  Eschaton doesn't like making direct actions and instead acts through other agents when possible.","word_list":"you might want to glance at singularity sky by charles stross   from the first bit of the wikipedia summary of the background \n\n gt  singularity sky takes place roughly in the early  rd century  around   years after an event referred to by the characters as the singularity  shortly after the earth s population topped   billion  computing technology began reaching the point where artificial intelligence could exceed that of humans through the use of closed timelike curves to send information to its past  suddenly  one day     of the population inexplicably disappeared \n\n gt  messages left behind  both on computer networks and in monuments placed on the earth and other planets of the inner solar system carry a short statement from the apparent perpetrator of this event \n\n gt   gt  i am the eschaton  i am not your god \n gt   gt  i am descended from you  and exist in your future \n gt   gt  thou shalt not violate causality within my historic light cone  or else \n\n gt  earth collapses politically and economically in the wake of this population crash  the internet engineering task force eventually assumes the mantle of the united nations  or at least its altruistic mission and charitable functions  anarchism replaces nation states  in the novel the un is described as having   of the planet s     polities as members  and its membership is not limited to polities \n\n gt  a century later  the first interstellar missions  using quantum tunnelling based jump drives to provide effective faster than light travel without violating causality  are launched  one that reaches barnard s star finds what happened to those who disappeared from earth  they were sent to colonise other planets via wormholes that took them back one year in time for every light year  ly  the star was from earth  gradually  it is learned  these colonies were scattered across a     ly area of the galaxy  all with the same message from the eschaton etched onto a prominent monument somewhere  there is also evidence that the eschaton has enforced the  or else  through drastic measures  such as inducing supernovae or impact events on the civilization that attempted to create causality violating technology \n\nvery little deals with eschaton itself    though it touches on it at times   eschaton doesn t like making direct actions and instead acts through other agents when possible "}

{"author":"13x666","body":"Today we've published our [Russian adaptation of 1412](http://xkcd.ru/1412/), and I decided to share the final result along with the story of how we made it.\n\nOur team has been working at the [xkcd.ru](http://xkcd.ru/) project for almost a year now (there were other guys before us), and we've translated and adapted a ton of strips (including [really](http://xkcd.ru/xkcd_img/1331/), [tough](http://xkcd.ru/1256/), [ones](http://xkcd.ru/1052/)). When we saw 1412, we were pretty excited.\n\nThis one wasn't too tough actually. It took us mere two days (those other examples took *much* longer). But it was one of the most fun to do translations/adaptations ever.\n\nImmediately after seeing the strip two of us independently downloaded a list of all Russian wikipedia article titles, a 73 MB file. I went on and wrote a quick script to filter out titles with incorrect number of syllables, and that left me with just 5 MB: around 140,000 candidates. Further filtering the list to only contain at least 4 words yielded 10,000 titles most of which were unsuitable: they had a wrong stress pattern and/or were names, toponyms or boring stuff like that. So there still was a task of finding the right ones by hand on both regular and 4-word lists. Other team members used other tricks or simply got lost in Wikipedia, following random links and hoping to find a \"turtle-article\" (surprisingly, that worked really well).\n\nWe then created a Google Docs document and spent several hours filling it with \"turtle-titles\", continuously laughing. The damned TMNT song got stuck in our heads, and right now it doesn't look like it's going anywhere, at least from mine (listening to 'The Purple People Eater' and 'Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini' does not help at all). We spoke the Turtle language along the way—a language where every phrase had \"the right syllable stress pattern\". You know, that's the kind of syndrome you can get by [playing too much 2048](http://xkcd.com/1344/)... Anyway, we ended up with around 200 ridiculously great titles, now we had to narrow it down to 60 and choose 6 of those to be TMNT logos...\n\nSo yeah, we did that too. Throwing all the good stuff away was painful, but we did it. On the other hand, imitating Randall's style in TMNT logos was a fun task.\n\nThere is a fundamental problem: Russian words are longer on average and have more syllables than English words, so following the pattern of the original, \"*at least four words ending in a noun*\", was simply impossible. Most of our titles are adjective-noun combos, but we do have our gems.\n\nSo these are the titles we ended up using for the TMNT logos:\n\n* [BLONDE GIRL jokes](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Анекдоты_о_блондинках) (Russian only) — yeah, ru.wiki has an article for that, complete with a photo of pink keyboard, but actually lacking a photo of a blonde girl...\n* [Snow White and the Seven DWARVES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs)\n* [MUHTAR's return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhtar%27s_return) — this is a Russian series about a dog detective. Not like a \"pet detective\", it's a dog who *is* a detective... but still close, right? :D\n* [BrainSTORMING method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming)\n* [Equality of men and WOMEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality) — some of those women ought to be science fiction authors.\n* [List of craters on VENUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_craters_on_Venus)\n\nAnd here's a few from the remaining 54, in random order:\n\n* Should a Hedgehog Have Spikes?\n* Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers\n* Toilet paper\n* Exclusive OR\n* Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson\n* How I Met Your Mother\n* Pornography in Russia\n* Right turn on red\n* Floating point numbers\n* Existential crisis\n* Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc\n* ...\n\nOverall, I think we've had about as much fun with this piece as Randall did, if not more, and the result makes us happy.

{"author":"rspeer","body":"I'm starting to do some frequency analysis, and it's promising.\n\nThe file uses a limited number of different byte values -- only 69 out of the 256 possible bytes.\n\n(Combined with the fact that a lot of the byte values it's using are in the range that UTF-8 uses, it's not surprising that it looks like a bunch of similar UTF-8 characters. And it's not that surprising that those characters would be Chinese. Throw a dart at Unicode and you'll probably hit Chinese.)\n\nHere's a plot where the x axis is the byte value, and the y axis is the number of times that byte occurs:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2wCciF3.png\n\nIf you sort them in rank order, the frequencies fall off exponentially for a while. Here's that plot with frequency on a log scale:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/O5pDt3T.png\n\nThe fact that the bytes have some kind of exponentially decreasing distribution to them implies that they're probably not just random noise, and not encrypted in any cryptographically strong way. There's some sort of signal or message to be found.\n\nIf it's text, it's not in any commonly-used encoding. It has a lot of byte 31 (0x1f) which is just into the useless-control-character range in almost all encodings. (EDIT: Not 25. Why did I think this was byte 25?) I am trying the uncommon ones now.\n\nIt could also be an image of some kind, with a curiously restricted palette. The number of bytes is 257 x 2240, among other factorings, if you want to try to make it into a rectangle.\n\n----\n\nI think I'm going to give up on the image approach for a while. If there was an image to be found, I should be able to reshape it somehow to get at least something that looks like a distorted, scrambled image. As opposed to this.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WxgGt3j.png\n\n----\n\n**Found something!**\n\nThis might explain why it looks like UTF-8. If you *add 1* to every byte, then decode as UTF-8, then it decodes completely. You still get mostly Chinese gibberish, with occasional characters from elsewhere in Unicode. But every 2-4 characters it has ASCII characters 0x20 through 0x23. Mostly 0x21, which is the exclamation mark.\n\nIt doesn't *mean* anything yet, but it may be another layer to decode. (And it may mean that I did something not quite right, and if you do something slightly different from what I did you get a better clue.)\n\nAfter shifting by one byte, the beginning of it looks like this:\n\n    硔椺 幅幊!幅䀈 滖燮!彍蠓!溝湃!邆뜷!뜸!曜䁈\"ꜷ!鵰邇夺!椻\"뜷\"궱彎徎\"鵱弎低!廍底弖\"走彍弎!Ꜷ!\n\nHere's the beginning of the characters one by one, with their Unicode codepoints, categories, and names:\n\n    U+7854  硔       [Lo] CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-7854\n    U+693A  椺       [Lo] CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-693A\n    U+0020           [Zs] SPACE\n    U+5E45  幅       [Lo] CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-5E45\n    U+5E4A  幊       [Lo] CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-5E4A\n    U+0021  !

{"author":"VorpalAuroch","body":"&gt;Apparently the basis is that you can make mutually beneficial agreements with people who don't exist yet.\n\nYeah, this is a really confusing idea when poorly stated (which is usually, Yudkowsky included). For a detailed discussion, look [here](http://mindingourway.com/newcomblike-problems-are-the-norm/) and the couple posts before it on Nate Soares's blog. But the summary is this:\n\nIn everyday life, whenever you interact with strangers you have partial knowledge of how they decide things, both based on knowing that they are humans are humans mostly work certain ways and by reading microexpressions, body language, etc., which people largely can't control consciously. Because this is true, we overwhelmingly make decisions as if the other person involved understands how we think to some degree, even when they have no ability to punish us if their understanding is wrong. \n\nGeneralizing and formalizing that strategy implies that you should act as though you were being simulated by someone who will give the 'real you' benefits if the simulation of you does what they want. ([Newcomb's Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox) is a thought experiment that tries to boil this down to something very explicit and simple.) Once you have that (and you need it to avoid being screwed, which is why all non-sociopaths have a mild version of it natively), it's a natural consequence that the simulation of you can happen at any time in the past or future. An example: Ancient Sufficiently Advanced Aliens have the option of preventing a supernova that would have killed us in -50 BCE, but think we might end up being rivals to them when we become Sufficiently Advanced ourselves and make contact with them. They simulate our future development, and they save us if and only if we seem like good future neighbors. Less compelling, less science-fictiony example: I talk with you about this kind of idea, and then later, by coincidence, we both show up on [Friend or Foe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend_or_Foe%3F_%28TV_series%29), the Prisoner's Dilemma game show. Knowing that our decisions cannot affect the other, but that we would both benefit from cooperating, we can each acausally trade with the other guy 30 seconds into the future and we can both walk away with several thousand dollars.\n\nIt gets more important if you also buy into the formulation of personal identity that argues that you after you wake up tomorrow morning is no different from a simulation of tomorrow morning from your perspective, run a thousand years in the future. It's hard to avoid something like this without buying into something else that  looks suspiciously like 'Souls exist'; LW's mainline strand of thought is that this notion of identity (called the 'pattern theory') is the only version compatible with quantum-aware strong materialism, which is a stronger conclusion than most philosophers take, but not unknown.","word_list":" gt apparently the basis is that you can make mutually beneficial agreements with people who don t exist yet \n\nyeah  this is a really confusing idea when poorly stated  which is usually  yudkowsky included   for a detailed discussion  look  here     and the couple posts before it on nate soares s blog  but the summary is this \n\nin everyday life  whenever you interact with strangers you have partial knowledge of how they decide things  both based on knowing that they are humans are humans mostly work certain ways and by reading microexpressions  body language  etc   which people largely can t control consciously  because this is true  we overwhelmingly make decisions as if the other person involved understands how we think to some degree  even when they have no ability to punish us if their understanding is wrong  \n\ngeneralizing and formalizing that strategy implies that you should act as though you were being simulated by someone who will give the  real you  benefits if the simulation of you does what they want    newcomb s problem     is a thought experiment that tries to boil this down to something very explicit and simple   once you have that  and you need it to avoid being screwed  which is why all non sociopaths have a mild version of it natively   it s a natural consequence that the simulation of you can happen at any time in the past or future  an example  ancient sufficiently advanced aliens have the option of preventing a supernova that would have killed us in    bce  but think we might end up being rivals to them when we become sufficiently advanced ourselves and make contact with them  they simulate our future development  and they save us if and only if we seem like good future neighbors  less compelling  less science fictiony example  i talk with you about this kind of idea  and then later  by coincidence  we both show up on  friend or foe      the prisoner s dilemma game show  knowing that our decisions cannot affect the other  but that we would both benefit from cooperating  we can each acausally trade with the other guy   seconds into the future and we can both walk away with several thousand dollars \n\nit gets more important if you also buy into the formulation of personal identity that argues that you after you wake up tomorrow morning is no different from a simulation of tomorrow morning from your perspective  run a thousand years in the future  it s hard to avoid something like this without buying into something else that  looks suspiciously like  souls exist   lw s mainline strand of thought is that this notion of identity  called the  pattern theory   is the only version compatible with quantum aware strong materialism  which is a stronger conclusion than most philosophers take  but not unknown "}

{"author":"DSMan195276","body":"The biggest problem with all of you arguments is that when /r/jailbait was taken down, the [rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules) were modified to reflect this new change in policy. Yes, the new rule was put in place *after* /r/jailbait was removed, but if it wasn't for this rule being put in place /r/jailbait may have very well been allowed back and they simply removed it while they were discussing what to do. They put the rule in place specifically because they didn't want /r/jailbait to have been removed for some arbitrary reason and not have it apply to everywhere equally. You are right, various mods agree or disagree with whether or not /r/jailbait used to be within the rules, but it's absolutely clear now that it's not even if it used to be.\n\n&gt; And how about the instances where mods and/or admins use those apparently inviolable rules to enforce their own policies? No matter how airtight you make them there will always be some asshole or another there to exploit every hole they can find. That is why simply pointing to the rules and saying \"follow those\" does not work. That is why relying on rules to sort things out does not work.\n\nThen you can complain that they're not following the rules, that's the *entire idea*. And yes, rules aren't perfect and will have to be updated from time to time.

So saying \"a new york times best seller\" could mean you had a lot of sales in one particular week in one particular city.  Additionally, if you published the book when nothing else came out that week, you have a pretty good chance of making the cut assuming you are slightly popular (you just need relative high sales in a given week in one of their cities).\n\nThat being said, just getting a book published is a huge accomplishment, and selling enough copies to get on any list is awesome.\n\nedit: (For the NYT best seller list, not amazon) apparently the reporting is weird:\n\n&gt; The Times provides booksellers with a form containing a list of books it believes might be bestsellers, to check off, with an alternative \"Other\" column to fill in manually.[4] It's been criticized as a leading technique to create a best-seller list based on books the Times thinks might be included.[4] One bookseller compared it to a voting card in which two options for President are provided: \"Bill Clinton and Other\".[4]\n\n\nedit2: Also apparently some authors or publishers can contract companies to buy books in bulk OR to avoid getting a \"dagger\" (Which appears when bulk orders are reported) buy many copies of the book individually.","word_list":" gt  is there funky  hollywood math  involved in publishing \n\ni am not sure how amazon s algorithm works but if very few popular books come out in one week  getting on the best seller list in a given week could just mean nothing else popular came out recently  \n\nthe new york times best seller list is often quoted  but it is based on data in one week  not a longer period of time    copies  imaginary units  in a week but never any copies again could make the list but   copies in a month would be a worse seller based on weekly data like the nyt does \n\nthere is also a national list based on a set of regional lists from a given set of cities   so saying  a new york times best seller  could mean you had a lot of sales in one particular week in one particular city   additionally  if you published the book when nothing else came out that week  you have a pretty good chance of making the cut assuming you are slightly popular  you just need relative high sales in a given week in one of their cities  \n\nthat being said  just getting a book published is a huge accomplishment  and selling enough copies to get on any list is awesome \n\nedit   for the nyt best seller list  not amazon  apparently the reporting is weird \n\n gt  the times provides booksellers with a form containing a list of books it believes might be bestsellers  to check off  with an alternative  other  column to fill in manually     it s been criticized as a leading technique to create a best seller list based on books the times thinks might be included     one bookseller compared it to a voting card in which two options for president are provided   bill clinton and other     \n\n\nedit   also apparently some authors or publishers can contract companies to buy books in bulk or to avoid getting a  dagger   which appears when bulk orders are reported  buy many copies of the book individually "}

{"author":"exDM69","body":"What makes you think that A.I. races would be more boring to watch than human racers? You can barely see the drivers when the race is on. Albeit the psychology factor does make it sometimes a bit more interesting but top-level racing drivers rarely succumb to pressure. Of course, the drivers are idolized and that brings a human element to an otherwise mechanical sport and I can understand the appeal in that.\n\nOne aspect that makes humans racers more interesting to watch is that they make more mistakes.\n\nBut why would AI races be interesting? Because the meatbag in the cockpit is dead weight that doesn't add any horsepower, and worse, they must make it out alive most of the time and that restricts how fast you can go.\n\nIf Colin Chapman (the genius behind Lotus F1 cars in 60s-80s) was still around, I'm sure he'd take the driver out as soon as it was feasible. \"Simplify, then add lightness\".\n\nIf we had AI races, we could make the cars go 400-500 km/h (assuming they'd be powered by conventional engines and use tyres, maybe even more if not) and corner at G forces that would make a human driver black out. That would be *spectacular*.\n\nHigher speeds and cornering forces means that aero drag and downforce play a bigger role, which would hopefully promote overtaking by drafting as well as force the cars to drive different lines through corners to avoid downforce loss due to turbulent air.\n\nIt would be different for sure, but would it be boring? I don't think so but I understand that someone might disagree with me.\n\nBut because state of the art in racing AIs is so poor, if you'd take the human out of the cockpit, the first step would be having humans at the wheel but controlled remotely.","word_list":"what makes you think that a i  races would be more boring to watch than human racers  you can barely see the drivers when the race is on  albeit the psychology factor does make it sometimes a bit more interesting but top level racing drivers rarely succumb to pressure  of course  the drivers are idolized and that brings a human element to an otherwise mechanical sport and i can understand the appeal in that \n\none aspect that makes humans racers more interesting to watch is that they make more mistakes \n\nbut why would ai races be interesting  because the meatbag in the cockpit is dead weight that doesn t add any horsepower  and worse  they must make it out alive most of the time and that restricts how fast you can go \n\nif colin chapman  the genius behind lotus f  cars in  s  s  was still around  i m sure he d take the driver out as soon as it was feasible   simplify  then add lightness  \n\nif we had ai races  we could make the cars go     km h  assuming they d be powered by conventional engines and use tyres  maybe even more if not  and corner at g forces that would make a human driver black out  that would be  spectacular  \n\nhigher speeds and cornering forces means that aero drag and downforce play a bigger role  which would hopefully promote overtaking by drafting as well as force the cars to drive different lines through corners to avoid downforce loss due to turbulent air \n\nit would be different for sure  but would it be boring  i don t think so but i understand that someone might disagree with me \n\nbut because state of the art in racing ais is so poor  if you d take the human out of the cockpit  the first step would be having humans at the wheel but controlled remotely "}

Personally I didn't understand how 1 degree could be so catastrophic, until I took AP Environmental Science, and meteorology in high school.

This is why it's so difficult to attest any one phenomenon directly to climate change. You can't say \"that hurricane is because of global warming!\". However, you can look at the statistical frequency of such events, and in numerous cases the data indicates a dramatic rise in extreme weather events. Biologically speaking we are also seeing many creatures shifting northward (at least in the Northern hemisphere) to compensate for the temperature changes. \n\nAll the evidence is very small, but globally it points to something huge. Changing one global degree could mean a 20 average change in Australia, or 30 degrees in Ecuador.

{"author":"QuelqueChoseRose","body":"&gt;wut?\n\nYou're criticizing a minor choice I made for no reason other than that you personally find it annoying and unnecessary, which assumes your opinion is inherently right, and that anyone who disagrees with you is wrong. And your description of a \"recently common habit\" has an air of \"kids these days...\" These are both things *xkcd* has criticized at some length:\n\n[603](http://www.xkcd.com/603/) [915](http://www.xkcd.com/915/) [1120](http://www.xkcd.com/1120/) [1215](http://www.xkcd.com/1215/) [1227](http://xkcd.com/1227/) [1314](http://www.xkcd.com/1314/) [1386](http://www.xkcd.com/1386/) [1414](http://www.xkcd.com/1414/)\n\nJust to name a few.\n\nAnyways, on to the rest of your comment:\n\nSo, I used the word \"so\" four times in my 447-word post. You say that's something that bothers you. And you're right that it may very well bother other people. But people who get bothered by casual tones in online comments are not people whose opinions I particularly care about. Now, taking your analogy, if I were writing professionally (which is indeed something I plan to do someday), then I'd feel differently. In professional writing, it absolutely is a problem to start three out of four consecutive paragraphs with the same conjunction. And in professional writing, you do have to take such complaints seriously to avoid losing popularity and never knowing why, as you say.\n\nBut I know all that. You're assuming this is how I always write. You're assuming that I didn't make a conscious decision to write in the way I did, and that I can't make a conscious decision to write other ways. These assumptions are incorrect. I would never use \"so\" in that way in something I were writing professionally, unless I were going for a deliberately casual feel. In fact, I just checked the short story I've been working on the past week, currently 2,800 words long, and I have not started a single sentence with the word \"so.\"\n\n\"So\" in this context is a word you use to tell a story. It's even how the great Seamus Heaney chose to translate the first word of English's oldest written story, *Beowulf*. It works in some contexts, like this post, and it doesn't in others, like the story I'm writing. Your purist view of language isn't \"wise.\" It's antiquated.","word_list":" gt wut \n\nyou re criticizing a minor choice i made for no reason other than that you personally find it annoying and unnecessary  which assumes your opinion is inherently right  and that anyone who disagrees with you is wrong  and your description of a  recently common habit  has an air of  kids these days     these are both things  xkcd  has criticized at some length \n\n                                                       \n\njust to name a few \n\nanyways  on to the rest of your comment \n\nso  i used the word  so  four times in my   word post  you say that s something that bothers you  and you re right that it may very well bother other people  but people who get bothered by casual tones in online comments are not people whose opinions i particularly care about  now  taking your analogy  if i were writing professionally  which is indeed something i plan to do someday   then i d feel differently  in professional writing  it absolutely is a problem to start three out of four consecutive paragraphs with the same conjunction  and in professional writing  you do have to take such complaints seriously to avoid losing popularity and never knowing why  as you say \n\nbut i know all that  you re assuming this is how i always write  you re assuming that i didn t make a conscious decision to write in the way i did  and that i can t make a conscious decision to write other ways  these assumptions are incorrect  i would never use  so  in that way in something i were writing professionally  unless i were going for a deliberately casual feel  in fact  i just checked the short story i ve been working on the past week  currently     words long  and i have not started a single sentence with the word  so  \n\n so  in this context is a word you use to tell a story  it s even how the great seamus heaney chose to translate the first word of english s oldest written story   beowulf   it works in some contexts  like this post  and it doesn t in others  like the story i m writing  your purist view of language isn t  wise   it s antiquated "}

{"author":"QuelqueChoseRose","body":"It's always seemed to me that Randall takes the characters' identities much less seriously than a lot of readers do. I guess Black Hat's always been pretty consistent, and nowadays Beret Guy is too, but even a character like White Hat, who often plays a very specific role in comics, will sometimes seem to be a totally different person than in his other appearances.\n\nWe also make some somewhat arbitrary distinctions. We call the plainest male stick figure Cueball, unless he's referred to as Rob in the comic, in which case we call him Rob. But we call the plainest female stick figure Megan, whether or not she's referred to as that in the comic. It would make more sense to assume that they're both always named Rob and Megan, or that they're both only named Rob or Megan if it's stated in the comic.\n\nAnyways, in this one I think the use of \"Meg\" is just a set-up for the joke in the title text, since Meg can also be a nickname for Margaret. The character could be Megan, or could be Danish, but her hair's actually different from both of theirs.

{"author":"tsahyt","body":"Just two obvious reasons why this isn't representative.\n\nFirst of all, your wordlist is really really small. When bruteforcing against a list of passwords using a dictionary you want the dictionary to be as big as possible, so the probability of actually finding a match is higher. Your wordlist is about 2700 words long. Wordlists that are commonly used are somewhere from 100000 to multiple *million* lines long. If your script exhausted all possible 4-word combinations, that'd make about 5e13 combinations, while with a small-ish common wordlist of 100000 words you're already at 1e20. That's a *big* difference. Coincidentally, your wordlist is also built such that \"correcthorsebatterystaple\" is the very first 4-word match that actually gets built.\n\nSecond, you're comparing plaintext strings. An attacker who has access to plaintext passwords doesn't need to bruteforce them. Intentionally slow and expensive hash algorithms like scrypt or bcrypt are used for a reason. The asymptotic runtime of any sort of brute force cracking is a given, so in order to ensure additional security beyond sheer password size, you want the constant to be as large as possible to make the cracking even more expensive. As an educated guess, you'd probably have to account for a factor of at least 1000 or so here.","word_list":"just two obvious reasons why this isn t representative \n\nfirst of all  your wordlist is really really small  when bruteforcing against a list of passwords using a dictionary you want the dictionary to be as big as possible  so the probability of actually finding a match is higher  your wordlist is about   words long  wordlists that are commonly used are somewhere from   to multiple  million  lines long  if your script exhausted all possible   word combinations  that d make about  e  combinations  while with a small ish common wordlist of   words you re already at  e   that s a  big  difference  coincidentally  your wordlist is also built such that  correcthorsebatterystaple  is the very first   word match that actually gets built \n\nsecond  you re comparing plaintext strings  an attacker who has access to plaintext passwords doesn t need to bruteforce them  intentionally slow and expensive hash algorithms like scrypt or bcrypt are used for a reason  the asymptotic runtime of any sort of brute force cracking is a given  so in order to ensure additional security beyond sheer password size  you want the constant to be as large as possible to make the cracking even more expensive  as an educated guess  you d probably have to account for a factor of at least   or so here "}

While his dismissal of the event with \"this used to happen all the time\"\" seems harmless enough, it's actually quite a divergence from the reality of the event. \n\nJanuary 6 2014 for St Louis was actually a very rare event, and there have only been a few days like it in the entire historic record.  The low of -7 F was very cold, but it was the fact that the high during the day never reached 0 F, with the wind chill starting off at 64 F below freezing, with the wind chill warming up to a high of 49 below freezing.  That's an incredibly cold day.

Only 5 days with a low that cold. \n\nI know I'm late to the topic, but somebody was wrong on the internet, and I couldn't let that happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","word_list":"the two days mentioned in the strip  jan   and      were actually an extreme anomaly for st louis   as well as most other locations effected by the unusual and extreme cold   while his dismissal of the event with  this used to happen all the time   seems harmless enough  it s actually quite a divergence from the reality of the event  \n\njanuary     for st louis was actually a very rare event  and there have only been a few days like it in the entire historic record   the low of    f was very cold  but it was the fact that the high during the day never reached   f  with the wind chill starting off at   f below freezing  with the wind chill warming up to a high of   below freezing   that s an incredibly cold day   it s not that it  dipped below zero for a couple of days   but in fact there had only been   previous days that cold  in the entire climate record of st louis   \nsource  \n\njan       dec       dec        jan      \nso it had been   years since a day that cold   and there is no way  this used to happen all the time   \n\njan     data source   amp req state na amp req statename na\n\nyou can see that while it barely reached   f after midnight  the daytime high never reached    and you can see the wind chill data  scroll down to the hourly readings \n\nalso  in the previous   years in st louis  there had been only   days with a low like there was on jan       only   days with a low that cold  \n\ni know i m late to the topic  but somebody was wrong on the internet  and i couldn t let that happen \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"author":"Macon-Bacon","body":"I really like the [philosophical idea]( http://existentialcomics.com/comic/1) of treating future selves as being completely different people. We change and develop a lot with time, even if we chronically underestimate how different our past selves were. If I were to take the person on the planet who was most similar to my way of thinking, and compare them to my way of thinking 30 years from now, it would probably make more sense to call the other person “me” than to call future me “me”. This has a lot of interesting implications. I basically have two choices: I can either become short-sighted and live in the moment, or I can reject shortsighted worldviews and do what is best for people like me (or even people in general).","word_list":"i really like the  philosophical idea      of treating future selves as being completely different people  we change and develop a lot with time  even if we chronically underestimate how different our past selves were  if i were to take the person on the planet who was most similar to my way of thinking  and compare them to my way of thinking   years from now  it would probably make more sense to call the other person “me” than to call future me “me”  this has a lot of interesting implications  i basically have two choices  i can either become short sighted and live in the moment  or i can reject shortsighted worldviews and do what is best for people like me  or even people in general  "}
