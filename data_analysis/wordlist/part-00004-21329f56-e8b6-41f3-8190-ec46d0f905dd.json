{"author":"romulusnr","body":"I think the trick is that it *completely ignores DST.* Which means it'll work for a few more weeks.\n\nDST is neither universal nor is it's application universal. Arizona completely ignores DST. Saskatchewan doesn't bother, but already is ahead an hour for its longitude. Most of Africa and Asia and half of South America don't bother. \n\nPlus, there are two different general periods of DST worldwide, since there are two different summers (north vs. south hemisphere).\n\nNot everyone even agrees on when DST/\"summer time\" starts. The U.S. unilaterally changed it a few years ago, but not everyone else did. For example, US DST starts on the second Sunday in March; but UK's BST starts on the *last* Sunday in March. Some shift at a certain time UTC while others (like the U.S.) shift at a certain *local* time. Some shift on Sunday while others shift on the previous Friday.\n\nFrankly, time zones simply aren't as neatly delineated as the comic makes them out to be. They are *generally* 30 degree longitude segments, but in actual use, the lines veer wildly from those nice neat paths, in some cases there are latitudes at which a given time zone doesn't actually exist. In some cases places use completely different time zones from the ones their longitudes would prescribe (e.g. Saskatchewan and most of Russia, which are an hour away; and elongated communities such as the Aleutians or other Pacific island chains). And then there's some places in e.g. India and Australia that observe *half hour* shifted time zones (e.g. to the west is 7PM, to the east is 9PM, and right here is 8:30PM).\n\n**TL;DR:** I think we get what we get.","word_list":"i think the trick is that it  completely ignores dst   which means it ll work for a few more weeks \n\ndst is neither universal nor is it s application universal  arizona completely ignores dst  saskatchewan doesn t bother  but already is ahead an hour for its longitude  most of africa and asia and half of south america don t bother  \n\nplus  there are two different general periods of dst worldwide  since there are two different summers  north vs  south hemisphere  \n\nnot everyone even agrees on when dst  summer time  starts  the u s  unilaterally changed it a few years ago  but not everyone else did  for example  us dst starts on the second sunday in march  but uk s bst starts on the  last  sunday in march  some shift at a certain time utc while others  like the u s   shift at a certain  local  time  some shift on sunday while others shift on the previous friday \n\nfrankly  time zones simply aren t as neatly delineated as the comic makes them out to be  they are  generally    degree longitude segments  but in actual use  the lines veer wildly from those nice neat paths  in some cases there are latitudes at which a given time zone doesn t actually exist  in some cases places use completely different time zones from the ones their longitudes would prescribe  e g  saskatchewan and most of russia  which are an hour away  and elongated communities such as the aleutians or other pacific island chains   and then there s some places in e g  india and australia that observe  half hour  shifted time zones  e g  to the west is  pm  to the east is  pm  and right here is    pm  \n\n  tl dr    i think we get what we get "}

Doing this from anything but a laptop or work computer isn't very practical - trying to use mouse on my iPad is pretty awful, and the remote apps don't really translate the touch screen as it if was a surface tablet (and I'm not aware that with a Surface, you can remotely log in a desktop Windows 8 and use it as a tablet).\n\n1) So first requirement: you need a integrated OS that works on both phones and desktops. Doesn't quite exists yet. And making an OS is a pretty huge barrier to entry. Might as well attempt to start an ISP.\n\nAs far as gaming goes, I suggest you give OnLive a try. It streams games to you in real-time (whereas console servers just do part of the work for you). Frankly, it's far from ideal.

With gigabit speeds, quality could increase, but lag will always remain an issue unless some sort of physically-near-the-home network of virtual machines service come to exists.\n\nThose are my thoughts so far, but yes, the benefits are there and it's very likely to become mainstream at some point.

And maintaining the user-specific state of an installed application the user paid for, but doing it all in the cloud introduces another layer of maintenance albeit it's doable, but I'd rather they just let an app be an app and let its developers focus on improving it instead of introducing more layers of maintenance by making it \"cloud!\", at least right now.\n\nSo yeah -- I pretty much completely agree with you.","word_list":"yeah  randall likes to be clever  but as a guy who s been in programming and webdev for years  i can t help but be like    eh  good try randall  you re a smarter guy than me in general  but this time it s a swing and a miss  web is often thin client  but even a thin client has to download and run scripts    and there s actually nothing stopping you from making a thin client non web application \n\ni guess the idea of having very small  fast apps behave like they have no installation process is kind of cute  and it s true that web based apps can have the real work installed and carried by a server  but the problem with bypassing the app installation process is that most apps can cost money and or need permission from the user to query data from the phone or user or other data  and an important part of the installation is making sure users consent to that  at least on android   and maintaining the user specific state of an installed application the user paid for  but doing it all in the cloud introduces another layer of maintenance albeit it s doable  but i d rather they just let an app be an app and let its developers focus on improving it instead of introducing more layers of maintenance by making it  cloud    at least right now \n\nso yeah    i pretty much completely agree with you "}

{"author":"itty53","body":"Eh, maybe. Not really. \n\nThe thing is I'm not e-mailing them to ask them random questions about their lives. Usually - most often - it's a thank you letter for something or another I thought merited one. The reply is usually words of encouragement and a 'thanks for caring, really, that meant a lot to hear'. \n\nThese kinds of people get 'thanked' at award dinners and stuff - never in any personal way I feel. So I try to express that to people I look up to. It's one thing when the guy introducing you praises you. It's another when a stranger does. \n\nOther times it's a question that an otherwise well-written article or documentary left unaddressed. Of course, no one is blatantly *rude* in a reply. They might be in disagreement, but not rude. A reply in and of itself is a courtesy; they're all courteous by definition. And I don't  bother e-mailing people I outright disagree with. That's just begging strangers for an argument. I typically agree with everything *but*, or everything *but you didn't answer this*. \n\nOne funny example was to a particular theoretical physicist who was working on time travel with lasers and 'bending space' and what-not. It all sounded incredibly scientific - and of course, lasers - but when he appeared on Through the Wormhole with a 'mockup model' of his 'potential time travel machine' and he was considered a *serious physicist*.. I had to ask him how that whole project was going, and whether any new discoveries had occurred in the field. I did it sincerely of course, but I basically knew what the answer would be. \n\nHe responded basically with a long-winded plea for money, in the hopes that I was some rich potential investor. He dodged around the question of any work he actually does and just basically said 'give me a million dollars; I can do it then'. I'm serious: He said something like \"I estimate we'll need 1 million to complete this project\". It really typified exactly how little I trust shows like that to be bearers of 'science', much less Morgan Freeman.  \n\nI think my favorite response from a 'random' celebrity was Nicholas Gurewitch, who makes [Perry Bible Fellowship](http://pbfcomics.com/). There's this over-arching theme in a lot of his comics that paint the fairer sex as traitorous - the subject of the comic gets cheated on all the time by one woman or another. I can't remember how I worded the question, but it was basically along the lines of 'Is this a personal thing for you, or are those comics more along the lines of satirizing society?'.

{"author":"Fordiman","body":"Ok, let's do some math.\n\nLet's assume that Santa needs to accelerate and decelerate back to zero for every stop one [article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/6859529/Father-Christmass-Christmas-Eve-in-figures.html) reasons that he has 32 hours to visit 700,000,000 Christians in a night, with a total distance of 342,510,000 km (this is not a travelling salesman solution, and the world is a \"square map\" for the number, so there's a good chance this is a vast overestimate).  \n\nAssuming that Santa's MO is to instantly teleport cookies and milk to the sleigh while simultaneously teleporting presents under trees, we'll say the entirety of his trip is consumed in travel - giving us a speed of 2,973 km/s - about 1/1000th the speed of light.  This is good, because it means we're far enough from c to largely ignore relativistic effects (but not enough to ignore friction - so we'll leave that out for now.  No sense in imagining a burning Santa when we already accept this isn't a thing).\n\nLet's also pick a mass for Santa's sleigh.  Santa himself is a big guy - call him 150 kg (~330 lbs).  He's also got \"eight _tiny_ reindeer\", so we'll go with the low end of the mass of an adult female deer, or 80 kg each.  Let's assume the sleigh is lightweight (Santa will have to have shaved some mass off his sleigh as the population rose to keep up), and is a polycarbonate construction weighing in at a mere 50 kg.  So 840kg.\n\nSo, at a minimum, we would need 3.7e15 joules for each change in speed, or 7.43e15 joules per stop.  We'd need to be able to extract that from an average of one glass of milk and one cookie.\n\nMilk is 87% water, so we can be assured that an 8 oz glass contains at least ~25 mol of hydrogen atoms.

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"1 Distance covered by person is 6t, distance covered by raptor is 1/2at^2 = 2t^2. So solve 2t^2 -40 =6t t=6.217. In 6.217 seconds **you could run 37.3 meters**. This only works if the raptor never reaches top speed but it doesn't because at the point of impact the raptor is only going at 6.217*4=24.87 m/s\n\n2 ~~I don't have time to work this out now but my instinct was to run directly away from the slowest raptor. This is on the basis that curved paths are slower than straight ones and so we should maximise how much of a curve the fast raptors have to run by allowing the slow one to run straight. I think I've proved that that is actually a bad idea below, or at very least I've failed to show it's a good idea.~~\n\n~~Supposing you were to run directly away from the slowest raptor. Assuming that by 20m triangle Randall means a triangle with 20m edges that means the raptor would start h=√3/2a A=h/3 so 2A= 11.54 meters away  Using the above we know that that raptor would reach top speed in 2.5 seconds in which time it would have covered 12.5 meters, at this point you'd be 11.54+2.5*6 -12.5 = 14.04 meters away. It would then catch you after a further 10t=6t+14.04 =3.51 seconds in which time you would have run a further 3.51 * 6 = 21.06 meters for a total distance of 35.1 meters.~~\n\n~~In the meantime the 2 side raptors will have run a sort of lobsided hyperbolic path with its asymptotes at the start and finish points of your run. It will be considerably longer than the distance from the point they started to the point they eat you x^2 = 10^2 +(35.1 - height )^2 x= 31.0 meters but a tad shorter than running to you and then running to that point (31.0+11.54 = 42.5 meters) so a fair guess is it will be around 39 or so meters. In the first 6 seconds (which is what we've been dealing with) these raptors won't have reached max speed but will have run (at^2 )/2 = 72 meters. (Damn, my hope was to show that the side raptors couldn't travel that distance in that time, thus proving you should run away from the slowest raptor, but it turns out they can, easily. It turns out curved lines aren't that much slower than straight ones.)~~\n\n~~So the side raptors will definitely catch you first. **This suggests you are better off running at one of two angles pointed almost towards but a bit to the side of the slow raptor.** But I'm not sure how you'd calculate the hyperbolic paths the raptors would follow so I'm a bit stuck. You might be able to do it with vectors but I don't have time to have a go right now. As you are buying yourself microseconds at most I think \"a bit to the right or left of the slow one\" will do as an answer.~~\n\nEdit: I've realised this is the wrong way to go about it. I still don't know how to go about it but I've worked out how to make a reasonable estimation.\n\nYou start in the middle of an equilateral triangle of raptors. Whenever you run further away from one you  run closer towards the other two at least until you are outside the triangle. So you want to get out of the triangle as quickly as possible. This would suggest running towards one of the three closest tangents to the triangle. It would also be logical to pick one of the two sides featuring the slower raptor.\n\nThe raptors are identical in speed for the first 2.5 seconds which is about all we get which again suggests running pretty much straight in between them. If we did that then we can discount the raptor that we're running directly away from, that one isn't going to catch us. In the first 2.5 seconds we'd have run 2.5*6 = 15 meters which would put us about 10m outside the circle (15 - 5.77). in that time the raptors would have run (at^2 )/2 = 12.5 meters but will have done so in an outward spiral toward our new position. So if we divide by a bit less than pi to simulate the effect that has we can see it will have moved about 4 meters toward us (this is the way you estimate river length, generally speaking because rivers take a curved path they are about pi times longer than the direct distance from source to sea). So by seeing that we are at the apex of a new triangle 12.5 meters high and with a base of 20 meters and each raptor is about 4 meters along the side of the triangle we can see that the raptors are x^2 = 10^2 + 12.5^2 x-4 = 12 meters behind us.\n\nFrom that point the raptor's path is still curved but it is considerably straighter so let's simulate it as a straight line. It's the fast raptor that catches us obviously and it will do so after (at^2 )/2=12 +6t t=4.37 seconds. Slighly longer as the fast raptor reaches top speed just before it catches you but lets ignore that for now.\n\nSo in those circumstances we survive for 4.37+2.5=6.87 seconds. In that time the slow raptor can travel 12.5 (as calculated previously) + 10*4.37 = 56.2 meters and the fast raptor can travel 78.1 meters while it is still accelerating and then 15.5 meters during its half second at top speed for a total distance of 93.6 meters.\n\nSo the slow raptor runs about 37.9% ie about 40% of the total distance of the distance run by both raptors.\n\nWhile it is not exactly right due to the curves in their trajectories, this would provide an argument for running toward a point on the edge of the triangle which is 40% toward the slower raptor. Using trig  is a bit of a pain (you start from the sin rule and then have to solve 8/sin a = 11.4 / sin (180 -30 - a) )but we can work out that means **running at an angle of about 35.5 degrees to north**.\n\nNow that's pretty approximate but what you could then do is work through the problem again feeding in the 35.5 degrees to north at the start and use that to get a more accurate estimate for time survived and plug that new estimate in in turn to get a better idea of which way to run. Iterate that several times and it will start to get more accurate, much more so if you can plot the exact path of the raptors and cut out some of our cruder assumptions.\n\nThis is assuming you have to run in a straight line. In actual fact you'd probably be better off starting off running directly in between the two raptors and then slowly bearing north. If you survive that long carry on bearing round and run behind the slow raptor. It won't help very much. Even the slow raptor can catch you in a few seconds.\n\nEdit 2 [various people have brute forced it in python](http://fora.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=120&amp;start=40). They get various different answers between 28 and 32 degrees, which makes my rough estimation look pretty decent. It looks like you can only survive for about 4 seconds tho. Using pi to approximate the raptor running spirals was very optimistic.\n\n3 We need the floor plan, also are all the raptors injured now?","word_list":"  distance covered by person is  t  distance

Then, it looks to match the *same* number of x characters some (integer) number of times (this is the \\1).  For example, if it matched xxx then it seeks to find xxx or xxxxxx or xxxxxxxxx, and so on.  Finally, it must find the start and end of the string (^ and $)—it has to make sure that it's using the *whole* string.\n\nThat portion of the regex will match any string that has a composite number of x characters—the number of characters can be written as M\\*N, so it will first match xx+ to xxxxx (M times), then it will match \\\\1+ to the remaining characters (M\\*(N-1) characters).  If there was a prime number of x characters then this is not possible.\n\nThe final trick is the ?! at the beginning, which looks to find a match of what follows it and causes the regex to *fail* to match in that case.","word_list":"spoiler \n\na the solution for  primes  is pretty interesting  disclaimer  i am not the original author of this regex  \n\n         xx       \n\nthis regex works by looking to match  xx   which matches xx  xxx  xxxx  xxxxx  etc—  or more  x  characters   then  it looks to match the  same  number of x characters some  integer  number of times  this is the       for example  if it matched xxx then it seeks to find xxx or xxxxxx or xxxxxxxxx  and so on   finally  it must find the start and end of the string    and   —it has to make sure that it s using the  whole  string \n\nthat portion of the regex will match any string that has a composite number of x characters—the number of characters can be written as m  n  so it will first match xx  to xxxxx  m times   then it will match      to the remaining characters  m   n    characters    if there was a prime number of x characters then this is not possible \n\nthe final trick is the    at the beginning  which looks to find a match of what follows it and causes the regex to  fail  to match in that case "}

I understand that it seems insignificant, but it will become incredibly annoying the longer I have to do it.\n\n&gt;&gt; These are already posts that you were planning on deleting. How much work is it really going to be to flair them instead?\n\n&gt; They'd even out. I'd have to go out to xkcd.com to see what comic number it is, then click the flair button, type in the comic number, and hit save. Alternatively, I would leave a comment informing them of the rule and remove it.\n\nI can imagine moderation in any form being annoying. Aiming to minimize it is a good goal.\n\n&gt; Moreover, I can add the rule to the submission text.\n\nGood idea.\n\n&gt; Deleting discussions hurts. I get it. I have to choose between the lesser of two evils here, (maybe) having to delete a few discussions early on to get the ball rolling, or abandon the rule. I think the second is the greater evil.\n\nFor a small subreddit like this content is the most desirable commodity. I don't think upvotes/downvotes even have an effect yet really in this subreddit. There isn't enough fresh content to vote on. Whatever is newest posted is pretty much guaranteed to end up at the top.\n\nDeleting content I therefore consider the least desirable course of action.\n\n&gt; *Hopefully* everyone will see the new rule and I won't have to remove anything.\n\nThat would be ideal, yes.\n\nThe problem only arises when reality fails to live up to this ideal.\n\n&gt; I'm on about 4-5 hours daily. The first thing I check is this sub and its modqueue. I understand that I can't be on all the time to delete these posts. I'm going to try my best to catch them before they get too big.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that by the time you log in the original poster may very well have already logged out. If you delete their post they may not be online to recreate it properly until a day or more later.\n\n---\n\nBest of luck modding.","word_list":" gt  gt  we re talking one or two posts a day  that seems manageable \n\n gt  every day  for the rest of my life  i understand that it seems insignificant  but it will become incredibly annoying the longer i have to do it \n\n gt  gt  these are already posts that you were planning on deleting  how much work is it really going to be to flair them instead \n\n gt  they d even out  i d have to go out to   to see what comic number it is  then click the flair button  type in the comic number  and hit save  alternatively  i would leave a comment informing them of the rule and remove it \n\ni can imagine moderation in any form being annoying  aiming to minimize it is a good goal \n\n gt  moreover  i can add the rule to the submission text \n\ngood idea \n\n gt  deleting discussions hurts  i get it  i have to choose between the lesser of two evils here   maybe  having to delete a few discussions early on to get the ball rolling  or abandon the rule  i think the second is the greater evil \n\nfor a small subreddit like this content is the most desirable commodity  i don t think upvotes downvotes even have an effect yet really in this subreddit  there isn t enough fresh content to vote on  whatever is newest posted is pretty much guaranteed to end up at the top \n\ndeleting content i therefore consider the least desirable course of action \n\n gt   hopefully  everyone will see the new rule and i won t have to remove anything \n\nthat would be ideal  yes \n\nthe problem only arises when reality fails to live up to this ideal \n\n gt  i m on about     hours daily  the first thing i check is this sub and its modqueue  i understand that i can t be on all the time to delete these posts  i m going to try my best to catch them before they get too big \n\nanother thing to consider is that by the time you log in the original poster may very well have already logged out  if you delete their post they may not be online to recreate it properly until a day or more later \n\n   \n\nbest of luck modding "}

{"author":"VorpalAuroch","body":"For one-time interactions with random strangers,  \"what I do to these people, they may do to me in return\" *is* acausal reasoning. This interaction will be done immediately, and they will never have another opportunity to affect you; from a causal decision theory standpoint (a.k.a. traditional Von-Neumann-Morgenstern game theory), there's no reason to cooperate. And yet humans reliably split the money in the ultimatum game approximately evenly, even while anonymous. There is no causal reason why they should do this; reputation effects are shielded off and it's not going to be repeated, so it has no lasting effects except how much money you get. Nevertheless, we refuse unbalanced splits and offer balanced ones. Something other than actual potential consequences to you is being considered here, and that means that necessarily we are using a simple version of acausal decision theory.\n\nThat's the thing about acausal reasoning; it sounds like outlandish science fiction, but it's just a formalization of long traditions of thought. Every time you act on a Kantian moral framework, you're using acausal reasoning: \"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\" is almost explicitly acausal.\n\nAlso, the other half of acausal reasoning is the *simulation* half, where we are modeling other people in our head to determine how to present ideas to them. And \"what you think you might get out of the interaction based on what you know about the individual\" is exactly that; a partial simulation of the other person which you're using to make your own decisions.\n\n(Sidenote: Our ultimatum game behavior is also why Roko's Basilisk could never work; we naturally refuse blackmail.)","word_list":"for one time interactions with random strangers    what i do to these people  they may do to me in return   is  acausal reasoning  this interaction will be done immediately  and they will never have another opportunity to affect you  from a causal decision theory standpoint  a k a  traditional von neumann morgenstern game theory   there s no reason to cooperate  and yet humans reliably split the money in the ultimatum game approximately evenly  even while anonymous  there is no causal reason why they should do this  reputation effects are shielded off and it s not going to be repeated  so it has no lasting effects except how much money you get  nevertheless  we refuse unbalanced splits and offer balanced ones  something other than actual potential consequences to you is being considered here  and that means that necessarily we are using a simple version of acausal decision theory \n\nthat s the thing about acausal reasoning  it sounds like outlandish science fiction  but it s just a formalization of long traditions of thought  every time you act on a kantian moral framework  you re using acausal reasoning   act only according to that maxim whereby you can  at the same time  will that it should become a universal law   is almost explicitly acausal \n\nalso  the other half of acausal reasoning is the  simulation  half  where we are modeling other people in our head to determine how to present ideas to them  and  what you think you might get out of the interaction based on what you know about the individual  is exactly that  a partial simulation of the other person which you re using to make your own decisions \n\n sidenote  our ultimatum game behavior is also why roko s basilisk could never work  we naturally refuse blackmail  "}

If you look at a book and plot the number of times words are used vs how often they are used you find they follow the same relationship (no matter what language). That's pretty cool right?

It's been suggested that the source of this law is a balance between minimal effort on the part of speakers to impart meaning and minimal effort for listeners to understand meaning. Languages evolved to follow this law because this way people using the languages are required to use the least amount of energy to communicate with each other.

I would say friend zoning is the situation where a male tries to date a woman only to be refused on the reason that \"it would ruin our friendship/we are better off as friends\".

Some men believe that this is in fact just a ploy because the girl doesn't see you as a sexual partner and performing certain actions will remove you from this \" friend zone\". There's a lot of objectifying and other stuff involved as well but let's not get into this.\n\nNow I don't agree with this at all.

{"author":"saigonsquare","body":"&gt;They honestly can't\n\nWell, first, that's just not true. Their hands-off approach is a self-imposed restriction. There is a very wide gulf between \"admins getting personally involved in daily dramatic minutiae\" and permitting holocaust deniers to hijack your website. Back during the \"jailbait\" scandal, the Reddit Party Line was that prohibiting pedophiles from running a creepshots-of-children ring would open the gates to jackbooted censorship. Turns out, it didn't. And it wouldn't here, either.\n\nEither way, the system here didn't really \"resolve itself;\" there was no internal balancing force at play. All signs are that the dude simply forgot his bi-monthly shitpost to keep that account active. To point to that and say, \"look, the system worked!!!\" is disingenuous.\n\nAnd it would be possible to create a truly self-resolving system. They could implement a \"recall\" feature by which X% of requests would trigger a vote. If that's too much, they could change the /r/redditrequest rules.
