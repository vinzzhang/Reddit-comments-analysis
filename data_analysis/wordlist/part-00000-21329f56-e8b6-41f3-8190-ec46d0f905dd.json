{"author":"shagieIsMe","body":"You might enjoy [Accelerando](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html) which he's released under a CC license.  And then you can wonder if a certain character is a friendly super-intelligence or not.\n\nIf you do go down the path of reading Accelerando, there's also some other references that may be fun to read up on.\n\nFrom Accelerando:\n\n&gt; Not everything is sweetness and light in the era of mature nanotechnology. Widespread intelligence amplification doesn't lead to widespread rational behavior. New religions and mystery cults explode across the planet; much of the Net is unusable, flattened by successive semiotic jihads. India and Pakistan have held their long-awaited nuclear war: external intervention by US and EU nanosats prevented most of the IRBMs from getting through, but the subsequent spate of network raids and Basilisk attacks cause havoc. Luckily, infowar turns out to be more survivable than nuclear war – especially once it is discovered that a simple anti-aliasing filter stops nine out of ten neural-wetware-crashing Langford fractals from causing anything worse than a mild headache.\n\nThis is a reference to David Langord's short stories including [BLIT](http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/blit.htm), [Different Kinds of Darkness](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/different-kinds-of-darkness/), and [comp.basilisk faq](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v402/n6761/full/402465a0.html).\n\nI'd also toss [Implied Spaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_Spaces) by Walter Jon Williams in there (possibly after reading [Glasshouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasshouse_(novel)) by Stross - its based on the culture portrayed in the last chapter of Accelerando):\n\n&gt; \"I and my confederates,\" Aristide said, \"did our best to prevent that degree of autonomy among artificial intelligences.  We made the decision to turn away from the Vingean Singularity before most people even knew what it was.  But—\" He made a gesture with his hands as if dropping a ball.  \"—I claim no more than the average share of wisdom.  We could have made mistakes.\n\nAnd of course, that would lead you to [The Peace War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peace_War) and [Marooned in Realtime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marooned_in_Realtime) by Verner Vinge.\n\nSo, there's a nice reading list:\n\n* BLIT short stories by Langford (many published online)\n* Accelerando by Stross (creative commons)\n* Glasshouse by Stross\n* Implied Spaces by Williams\n* Across Realtime series by Vinge\n\nand oh yea...\n\n* Singularity Sky by Stross\n* Iron Sunrise by Stross","word_list":"you might enjoy  accelerando     which he s released under a cc license   and then you can wonder if a certain character is a friendly super intelligence or not \n\nif you do go down the path of reading accelerando  there s also some other references that may be fun to read up on \n\nfrom accelerando \n\n gt  not everything is sweetness and light in the era of mature nanotechnology  widespread intelligence amplification doesn t lead to widespread rational behavior  new religions and mystery cults explode across the planet  much of the net is unusable  flattened by successive semiotic jihads  india and pakistan have held their long awaited nuclear war  external intervention by us and eu nanosats prevented most of the irbms from getting through  but the subsequent spate of network raids and basilisk attacks cause havoc  luckily  infowar turns out to be more survivable than nuclear war – especially once it is discovered that a simple anti aliasing filter stops nine out of ten neural wetware crashing langford fractals from causing anything worse than a mild headache \n\nthis is a reference to david langord s short stories including  blit       different kinds of darkness      and    faq     \n\ni d also toss  implied spaces     by walter jon williams in there  possibly after reading  glasshouse    novel   by stross   its based on the culture portrayed in the last chapter of accelerando  \n\n gt   i and my confederates   aristide said   did our best to prevent that degree of autonomy among artificial intelligences   we made the decision to turn away from the vingean singularity before most people even knew what it was   but—  he made a gesture with his hands as if dropping a ball    —i claim no more than the average share of wisdom   we could have made mistakes \n\nand of course  that would lead you to  the peace war     and  marooned in realtime     by verner vinge \n\nso  there s a nice reading list \n\n  blit short stories by langford  many published online \n  accelerando by stross  creative commons \n  glasshouse by stross\n  implied spaces by williams\n  across realtime series by vinge\n\nand oh yea   \n\n  singularity sky by stross\n  iron sunrise by stross"}

{"author":"UnthinkingMajority","body":"I'm not really sure how to explain this, then. What this chart looks at is how the number of references drops as a comic's popularity decreases. The WAY the number of references decrease is what's interesting.\n\n&gt; I defined x to be the number of references, and I defined C(x) to be the comic ranking\n\nThe X-axis (horizontal) is the popularity ranking of the comic. X = 1 means that this comic was referenced the most, x = 2 means the second most, and so on. The vertical axis corresponds to the total number of references. Clearly the most popular post will be referenced the most, this is trivial. However, we are interested in the relationship between total number of references and position ranking.\n\nTo be clear here, there isn't an \"independent variable\": we are comparing two variables about a comic (its ranking and the total number of times it has been referenced). However, because there is a definite order to these comics (there will always be a most referenced comic, and so on), so it makes sense to put these on the horizontal axis as it will exist independently of what specific comic is first.\n\n&gt;There is nothing interesting about taking some input z, transforming it via some known f(z), plotting w/ f(z) on the horizontal axis and z on the vertical axis and the remarking how amazing this relationship is.\n\nThen you have missed the point of this post.

{"author":"go24","body":"&gt;You are advocating silence and migration instead of active community participation\n\nI'm advocating community participation in a subreddit that is modded by mods you approve of. The subreddit belongs to the mod(s), like it or not. The mods can drive all the users away, or attract more, but unless they do something actually illegal or against the most important rules of reddiquette, they're there to stay. \n\n&gt;it is pretty fucking clear the majority of /r/xkcd doesn't like /u/soccer's moderating decisions.\n\nUnder 300 people have upvoted this post and the petition at the time I'm posting this response, about 10 hours after the , /r/XKCD has over 44,000 subscribers. Majority? On the contrary, the people complaining are statistically insignificant. \n\n&gt; The subreddit is the sum of the submitters and subscribers, the mods are just there to grease the wheels\n\nWow, you really don't get reddit, do you? Reddit is a popularity contest for mods. Mods can make or break a subreddit at any time. Submitters come and go. Consider /u/DrJulianBashir/. He used to submit 5 or 10 things a day, now he's down to 1 or 2 a week. The subreddits he used to submit to have all survived quite nicely. Submitters and subscribers are only significant as numbers; they are easily replaced if the sub is popular, and the mods can affect that orders of magnitude more than the users. Reddit is a microcosm of society. If the manager of your local pub and you don't get along but lots of people go there and don't seem to have a problem with him, you're not going to get him fired unless you can prove he's breaking the law. The only recourse you have if you are a submitter and/or subscriber who doesn't like the mods is to ditch the subreddit. \n\n&gt; having a bitch about the subscribers calling out a mod is some serious hypocrisy\n\nI don't see how. I'm just telling you less than three hundred unhappy souls that there are better ways to spend your time. There is some bitching about /u/soccer every once in a while, but he remains. He may or may not believe in some of the stuff he posts, but he's smart enough to not break any rules that will get him thrown out. You folks go ahead and have your little circlejerk and downvote people that promote common sense if it makes you feel like you're making things better. All you are actually doing is giving /u/soccer a laugh. Some of you will figure things out eventually, some will never catch on. I get the same type of entertainment from you lot as I do from YouTube videos of puppies trying to figure out stairs.

This is a true story.\n\n    What a lot of people didn’t realize was that Clippy, by default, sent anything you asked it to Microsoft, anonymized.\n\n    No evil intent. We had no idea who asked what. It was a way of knowing what we’d screwed up. Lots of queries on a topic? Bad feature design.\n\n    One day one of the PMs in charge of monitoring Clippy’s logs found a story, told in fragments.\n\n    Somebody, probably a woman in the US Midwest, was typing a sentence at a time. Clippy would answer nonsensically. She’d type another one.\n\n    She’d lost her job. Her boyfriend was beating her. She was so lonely, and so afraid. All her waking nightmares, told to a paperclip.\n\n    We couldn’t help. We didn’t know who she was. We’d gone to great lengths to make sure that we COULD not know who she was.\n\n    So we read her story. One sentence after another. Soul-searing honesty, told to a little paperclip that could never, ever answer her.\n\n    I often wonder what happened to that woman. I hope she’s okay.

{"author":"Kattzalos","body":"My favorite, from /r/badphilosophy:\n\nOn Twin Earth, a brain in a vat is at the wheel of a runaway trolley. There are only two options that the brain can take: the right side of the fork in the track or the left side of the fork. There is no way in sight of derailing or stopping the trolley and the brain is aware of this, for the brain knows trolleys. The brain is causally hooked up to the trolley such that the brain can determine the course which the trolley will take.\n\nOn the right side of the track there is a single railroad worker, Jones, who will definitely be killed if the brain steers the trolley to the right. If the railman on the right lives, he will go on to kill five men for the sake of killing them, but in doing so will inadvertently save the lives of thirty orphans (one of the five men he will kill is planning to destroy a bridge that the orphans' bus will be crossing later that night). One of the orphans that will be killed would have grown up to become a tyrant who would make good utilitarian men do bad things. Another of the orphans would grow up to become G.E.M. Anscombe, while a third would invent the pop-top can.\n\nIf the brain in the vat chooses the left side of the track, the trolley will definitely hit and kill a railman on the left side of the track, \"Leftie\" and will hit and destroy ten beating hearts on the track that could (and would) have been transplanted into ten patients in the local hospital that will die without donor hearts. These are the only hearts available, and the brain is aware of this, for the brain knows hearts. If the railman on the left side of the track lives, he too will kill five men, in fact the same five that the railman on the right would kill. However, \"Leftie\" will kill the five as an unintended consequence of saving ten men: he will inadvertently kill the five men rushing the ten hearts to the local hospital for transplantation. A further result of \"Leftie's\" act would be that the busload of orphans will be spared. Among the five men killed by \"Leftie\" are both the man responsible for putting the brain at the controls of the trolley, and the author of this example. If the ten hearts and \"Leftie\" are killed by the trolley, the ten prospective heart-transplant patients will die and their kidneys will be used to save the lives of twenty kidney-transplant patients, one of whom will grow up to cure cancer, and one of whom will grow up to be Hitler. There are other kidneys and dialysis machines available, however the brain does not know kidneys, and this is not a factor.\n\nAssume that the brain's choice, whatever it turns out to be, will serve as an example to other brains-in-vats and so the effects of his decision will be amplified. Also assume that if the brain chooses the right side of the fork, an unjust war free of war crimes will ensue, while if the brain chooses the left fork, a just war fraught with war crimes will result. Furthermore, there is an intermittently active Cartesian demon deceiving the brain in such a manner that the brain is never sure if it is being deceived.\n\n**QUESTION: What should the brain do?**","word_list":"my favorite  from  r badphilosophy \n\non twin earth  a brain in a vat is at the wheel of a runaway trolley  there are only two options that the brain can take  the right side of the fork in the track or the left side of the fork  there is no way in sight of derailing or stopping the trolley and the brain is aware of this  for the brain knows trolleys  the brain is causally hooked up to the trolley such that the brain can determine the course which the trolley will take \n\non the right side of the track there is a single railroad worker  jones  who will definitely be killed if the brain steers the trolley to the right  if the railman on the right lives  he will go on to kill five men for the sake of killing them  but in doing so will inadvertently save the lives of thirty orphans  one of the five men he will kill is planning to destroy a bridge that the orphans  bus will be crossing later that night   one of the orphans that will be killed would have grown up to become a tyrant who would make good utilitarian men do bad things  another of the orphans would grow up to become g e m  anscombe  while a third would invent the pop top can \n\nif the brain in the vat chooses the left side of the track  the trolley will definitely hit and kill a railman on the left side of the track   leftie  and will hit and destroy ten beating hearts on the track that could  and would  have been transplanted into ten patients in the local hospital that will die without donor hearts  these are the only hearts available  and the brain is aware of this  for the brain knows hearts  if the railman on the left side of the track lives  he too will kill five men  in fact the same five that the railman on the right would kill  however   leftie  will kill the five as an unintended consequence of saving ten men  he will inadvertently kill the five men rushing the ten hearts to the local hospital for transplantation  a further result of  leftie s  act would be that the busload of orphans will be spared  among the five men killed by  leftie  are both the man responsible for putting the brain at the controls of the trolley  and the author of this example  if the ten hearts and  leftie  are killed by the trolley  the ten prospective heart transplant patients will die and their kidneys will be used to save the lives of twenty kidney transplant patients  one of whom will grow up to cure cancer  and one of whom will grow up to be hitler  there are other kidneys and dialysis machines available  however the brain does not know kidneys  and this is not a factor \n\nassume that the brain s choice  whatever it turns out to be  will serve as an example to other brains in vats and so the effects of his decision will be amplified  also assume that if the brain chooses the right side of the fork  an unjust war free of war crimes will ensue  while if the brain chooses the left fork  a just war fraught with war crimes will result  furthermore  there is an intermittently active cartesian demon deceiving the brain in such a manner that the brain is never sure if it is being deceived \n\n  question  what should the brain do   "}

{"author":"EliezerYudkowsky","body":"(edited to make clear what this is all about)\n\nHi!  This is Eliezer Yudkowsky, original founder but no-longer-moderator of LessWrong.com and also by not-quite-coincidence the first AI In A Box Roleplayer Guy.  I am also the author of \"Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality\", a controversial fanfic which causes me to have a large, active Internet hatedom that does not abide by norms for reasoned discourse.  You should be very careful about believing any statement supposedly attributed to me that you have not seen directly on an account or page I directly control.\n\nI was brought here by a debate in the comments about \"Roko's Basilisk\" mentioned in 1450's alt tag.  Roko's Basilisk is a weird concept which a *false* Internet meme says is believed on LessWrong.com and used to solicit donations (this has never happened on LessWrong.com or anywhere else, ever).  The meme that this is believed on LessWrong.com or used to solicit donations was spread by a man named David Gerard who made over 300 edits to the RationalWiki page on Roko's Basilisk, though the rest of RationalWiki does seem to have mostly gone along with it.\n\nThe tl;dr on Roko's Basilisk is that a sufficiently powerful AI will punish you if you did not help create it, in order to give you an incentive to create it.\n\nRationalWiki basically invented Roko's Basilisk as a *meme* - not the original concept, but the meme that there's anyone out there who believes in Roko's Basilisk and goes around advocating that people should create AI to avoid punishment by it.  So far as I know, literally nobody has ever advocated this, ever.  Roko's original article basically said \"And therefore you SHOULD NOT CREATE [particular type of AI that Yudkowsky described that has nothing to do with the Basilisk and would be particularly unlikely to create it even given other premises], look at what a DANGEROUS GUY Yudkowsky is for suggesting an AI that would torture people that didn't help create it\" [it wouldn't].\n\nIn the hands of RationalWiki generally, and RationalWiki leader David Gerard particularly who also [wrote a wiki article smearing effective altruists that must be read to be believed](http://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Effective_altruism&amp;oldid=1316574), this somehow metamorphosed into a Singularity cult that tried to get people to believe a Pascal's Wager argument to donate to their AI god on pain of torture.  This cult that has literally never existed anywhere except in the imagination of David Gerard.\n\nI'm a bit worried that the alt text of XKCD 1450 indicates that Randall Munroe thinks that there actually *are* \"Roko's Basilisk people\" somewhere and that there's fun to be had in mocking them (another key part of the meme RationalWiki spreads), but this is an understandable mistake since Gerard et. al. have more time on their hands and have conducted a quite successful propaganda war.  With tacit cooperation from a Slate reporter who took everything in the RationalWiki article at face value, didn't contact me or anyone else who could have said otherwise, and engaged in that particular bit of motivated credulity to use in a drive-by shooting attack on Peter Thiel who was heavily implied to be funding AI work because of Basilisk arguments; to the best of my knowledge Thiel has never said anything about Roko's Basilisk, ever, and I have no positive indication that Thiel has ever heard of it, and he was funding AI work long long before then, etcetera.  And then of course it was something the mainstream media had reported on and that was the story.  I mention this to explain why it's understandable that Munroe might have bought into the Internet legend that there are \"Roko's Basilisk people\" since RationalWiki won the propaganda war to the extent of being picked up by a Slate reporter that further propagated the story widely.  But it's still, you know, disheartening.\n\nIt violates discourse norms to say things like the above without pointing out specific factual errors being made by RationalWiki, which I will now do.  Checking the current version of the Roko's Basilisk article on RationalWiki, virtually everything in the first paragraph is mistaken, as follows:\n\n&gt; Roko's basilisk is a proposition that says an all-powerful artificial intelligence from the future may retroactively punish those who did not assist in bringing about its existence.\n\nRoko's basilisk was the proposition that a self-improving AI that was sufficiently powerful could do this; all-powerful is not required.  Note hyperbole.\n\n&gt; It resembles a futurist version of Pascal's wager; an argument used to try and suggest people should subscribe to particular singularitarian ideas, or even donate money to them, by weighing up the prospect of punishment versus reward. \n\n**This sentence is a lie**, originated and honed by RationalWiki with the deliberate attempt to smear the reputation of what, I don't know, Gerard sees as an online competitor or something.  Nobody ever said \"Donate so the AI we build won't torture you.\"  I mean, who the bleep would think that would work even if they believed in the Basilisk thing?  Gerard made this up.\n\n&gt; Furthermore, the proposition says that merely knowing about it incurs the risk of punishment. \n\nThis is a bastardization of work that I and some other researchers did on Newcomblike reasoning in which, e.g., we proved mutual cooperation on the oneshot Prisoner's Dilemma between agents that possess each other's source code and are simultaneously trying to prove theorems about each other's behavior.  See http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5577  The basic adaptation to Roko's Basilisk as an infohazard is that if you're not even thinking about the AI at all, it can't see a dependency of your behavior on its behavior because you won't have its source code if you're not thinking about it at all.  This doesn't mean if you are thinking about it, it will get you; I mean it's not like you could prove things about an enormous complicated AI even if you did have the source code, and it has a resource-saving incentive to do the equivalent of \"defecting\" by making you believe that it will torture you and then not bothering to actually carry out the threat.  Cooperation on the Prisoner's Dilemma via source code simulation isn't easy to obtain, it would be easy for either party to break if they wanted, and it's only the common benefit of cooperation that establishes a motive for rational agents to preserve the delicate conditions for mutual cooperation on the PD.  There's no motive on your end to carefully carry out necessary conditions to be blackmailed.  (But taking Roko's premises at face value, his idea would zap people as soon as they read it.  Which - keeping in mind that at the time I had absolutely no idea this would all blow up the way it did - caused me to yell quite loudly at Roko for violating ethics given his own premises, I mean really, WTF?  You're going to get everyone who reads your article tortured so that you can argue against an AI proposal?   In the twisted alternate reality of RationalWiki, this became proof that I believed in Roko's Basilisk, since I yelled at the person who invented it without including twenty lines of disclaimers about what I didn't necessarily believe.   And since I had no idea this would blow up that way at the time, I suppose you could even read the sentences I wrote that way, which I did not edit for hours first because I had no idea this was going to haunt me for years to come.  And then, since Roko's Basilisk was a putatively a pure infohazard of no conceivable use or good to anyone, and since I didn't really want to deal with the argument, I deleted it from LessWrong which seemed to me like a perfectly good general procedure for dealing with putative pure infohazards that jerkwads were waving in people's faces.  Which brought out the censorship!! trolls and was certainly, in retrospect, a mistake.)\n\n&gt; It is also mixed with the ontological argument, to suggest this is even a reasonable threat. \n\nI have no idea what \"ontological argument\" is supposed to mean here.  If it's the ontological argument from theology, as was linked, then this part seems to have been made up from thin air.  I have never heard the ontological argument associated with anything in this sphere, except on this RationalWiki article itself.\n\n&gt; It is named after the member of the rationalist community LessWrong who most clearly described it (though he did not originate it).\n\nRoko did in fact originate it. Also, anyone can sign up for LessWrong.com, David Gerard has an account there but that doesn't make him a \"member of the rationalist community\".\n\nAnd that is just the opening paragraph.\n\nI'm a bit sad that Randall Monroe seems to possibly have jumped on this bandwagon - since it was started by people who were playing the role of jocks sneering at nerds, the way they also sneer at effective altruists, and having XKCD join in on that feels very much like your own mother joining the gang hitting you with baseball bats.  On the other hand, RationalWiki has conducted a very successful propaganda campaign here.  So it's saddening but not too surprising if Randall Monroe has never heard hinted any version but RationalWiki's.  I hope he reads this and reconsiders.","word_list":" edited to make clear what this is all about \n\nhi   this is eliezer yudkowsky  original founder but no longer moderator of   and also by not quite

{"author":"DSMan195276","body":"&gt; any more than their efforts to ban anyone promoting their own material does.\n\nPeople get banned for breaking the rules. There aren't any rules saying you can't 'promote your own material', there just are rules surrounding how you're allowed to do so (Ex. *Not* through vote manipulation).\n\n&gt; In no right-thinking world would an anti-Semite holocaust denier be allowed to run an area of a website called /r/holocaust[1]\n\nWhy not? I don't like it either but it'd be no different then if he managed to register www.holocaust.com before anybody else (Unless you're one who'd rather government's remove websites from people if they don't like the content). Subreddit's aren't that different from separate websites, and are treated similarly. He gained the subreddit though legitimate means and held-on to it within the rules of being a subreddit moderator. Yes it pissed me off and I'm happy he's gone, but he wasn't breaking any rules.\n\nHonestly, the last thing we want is Reddit involved in subreddit politics anymore then they already are. They're hands-off because not every case is as 'clear-cut' as this one, and if they start removing moderators that *aren't* breaking any rules, things will get ugly in a hurry. Reddit would be opening themselves up to tons of \"Please remove this head-mod because they aren't doing anything, or doesn't agree with this stance, or etc.\", and instead of being able to respond \"Reddit doesn't get involved in subreddit politics\", now that response really means \"Sorry, that head-mod isn't bad enough to be removed\".\n\nAgain, perhaps the /r/holocaust seems like an \"Obvious\" situation, but what about a subreddit like /r/abortion? Who should get to control that subreddit, pro-life or pro-choice moderators? Reddit has *specifically* avoided making that choice by allowing whoever creates it first to be the moderator over it (Within specific guidelines). If they were to remove the mod from /r/holocaust because it was anti-Semite and about holocaust denial, then they're opening themselves up to have to decide whether or not something like /r/abortion or /r/birthcontrol or /r/vaccineMyths or whatever subreddit you want should really be tailored to a different viewpoint, and honestly at that point we're diving into censorship territory.","word_list":" gt  any more than their efforts to ban anyone promoting their own material does \n\npeople get banned for breaking the rules  there aren t any rules saying you can t  promote your own material   there just are rules surrounding how you re allowed to do so  ex   not  through vote manipulation  \n\n gt  in no right thinking world would an anti semite holocaust denier be allowed to run an area of a website called  r holocaust   \n\nwhy not  i don t like it either but it d be no different then if he managed to register   before anybody else  unless you re one who d rather government s remove websites from people if they don t like the content   subreddit s aren t that different from separate websites  and are treated similarly  he gained the subreddit though legitimate means and held on to it within the rules of being a subreddit moderator  yes it pissed me off and i m happy he s gone  but he wasn t breaking any rules \n\nhonestly  the last thing we want is reddit involved in subreddit politics anymore then they already are  they re hands off because not every case is as  clear cut  as this one  and if they start removing moderators that  aren t  breaking any rules  things will get ugly in a hurry  reddit would be opening themselves up to tons of  please remove this head mod because they aren t doing anything  or doesn t agree with this stance  or etc    and instead of being able to respond  reddit doesn t get involved in subreddit politics   now that response really means  sorry  that head mod isn t bad enough to be removed  \n\nagain  perhaps the  r holocaust seems like an  obvious  situation  but what about a subreddit like  r abortion  who should get to control that subreddit  pro life or pro choice moderators  reddit has  specifically  avoided making that choice by allowing whoever creates it first to be the moderator over it  within specific guidelines   if they were to remove the mod from  r holocaust because it was anti semite and about holocaust denial  then they re opening themselves up to have to decide whether or not something like  r abortion or  r birthcontrol or  r vaccinemyths or whatever subreddit you want should really be tailored to a different viewpoint  and honestly at that point we re diving into censorship territory "}

{"author":"TheJones777","body":"That's a great point. I have come to believe that I have my beliefs and how I see the world, and to me that is truth. But other people see the world differently and hold different truths. Our personal realities seem 100% genuine and true to us which is fine. But I also believe in an absolute truth that we will find out at some point whether in this life or after. But in regards to 'crossing a line', I think that will largely depend on societal trends and how a lot of issues are viewed. I think the movie Gattaca paints a somewhat realistic version of a possible future for humanity. A lot of people (myself included) would consider eugenics on that level as crossing a line, but what if you're a parent and a doctor comes to you and says that your child will have a seriously debilitating disease unless you alter some gene. I think the idea of 'crossing a line' paints a picture that is too black and white in relation to how society changes (I won't say 'evolves' because I'm not 100% sold that we're any 'better' as a species than we were 2000 years ago) Society will inevitably change. There is no way to stop it without eliminating society.

Proving that consent was or was not given ahead of time, and not revoked at any point while awake is way harder, and would basically render the outcome of any trial entirely dependent on who has a better lawyer.\n\nEthically, however, when you consider the true state of mind of every participant rather than what can or cannot be proven - you should be able to do so. First, rape is bad because it violates the will of a person about what to do with their body, and does it in a traumatizing way. In case of an unconscious person, since unconscious people don't have a will in the same sense as conscious people do, we extrapolate the will from the last conscious state. If it didn't include the intention to have sex (like it can be the case of being subjected to rape drugs), then it's obviously rape. By applying the same standard of extrapolating the will from last conscious state, if the person wanted to participate in unconscious sex all the time while awake, then it shouldn't be rape. Second, people can already consent to all sorts of medical procedures under anesthesia. In some places, people can even consent to euthanasia for the case of their being in coma, and certain conditions about their organism are met. Generally, doing something to an unconscious person that they asked to do while awake is considered ethically acceptable, even in cases when doing so against their will would be considered very unacceptable. There doesn't seem to be a reason why sex is significantly different from these other cases. Thus, it has to be possible to consent ahead of time.","word_list":"legally   no  and for a good reason  it s already hard enough to prove the presence or absence of consent at the moment of sex  proving that consent was or was not given ahead of time  and not revoked at any point while awake is way harder  and would basically render the outcome of any trial entirely dependent on who has a better lawyer \n\nethically  however  when you consider the true state of mind of every participant rather than what can or cannot be proven   you should be able to do so  first  rape is bad because it violates the will of a person about what to do with their body  and does it in a traumatizing way  in case of an unconscious person  since unconscious people don t have a will in the same sense as conscious people do  we extrapolate the will from the last conscious state  if it didn t include the intention to have sex  like it can be the case of being subjected to rape drugs   then it s obviously rape  by applying the same standard of extrapolating the will from last conscious state  if the person wanted to participate in unconscious sex all the time while awake  then it shouldn t be rape  second  people can already consent to all sorts of medical procedures under anesthesia  in some places  people can even consent to euthanasia for the case of their being in coma  and certain conditions about their organism are met  generally  doing something to an unconscious person that they asked to do while awake is considered ethically acceptable  even in cases when doing so against their will would be considered very unacceptable  there doesn t seem to be a reason why sex is significantly different from these other cases  thus  it has to be possible to consent ahead of time "}

{"author":"Kirsham","body":"Let's say you have a normally distributed population with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Let's say you were to pull a sample from this population. Because of random chance, you wouldn't always get a sample with a mean of 100. In fact, if you pulled many samples from the population, most of the sample means would not be 100, but you would get more samples close to 100 and less samples far away from 100. If you were to pull an infinite number of samples and plotted the means in each sample, you would find that the means would follow what is known as the t-distribution.\n\nNote, however, that pulling an infinite number of samples is obviously impossible. The t-distribution is a theoretical distribution, and is used to determine the probability that a sample was drawn from a population. \n\nHere's a made up example as a demonstration: Let's say you have tested the IQ of 100 professors, and their mean IQ was 135. The mean IQ in the overall population of humans is 100 (by definition). Now you ask yourself, do professors on average have a higher IQ than the overall population? To answer this, you estimate the probability that your data arose given that the opposite is true, namely that professors do not differ from the overall population in terms of IQ. Here's where the t-distribution comes into play. Remember when we pulled an infinite number of samples, and plotted them? Remember how most of the samples were close to 100? That means that if our sample is sufficiently far away from 100, we can say that it's unlikely that we obtained our sample mean by pure chance. In our example (mean of 100, standard deviation of 15), 95% of samples drawn would have an average IQ of between 70 and 130. This means that it's fairly unlikely (less than 5% chance) that our data, with its mean of 135, was drawn from the same population as the overall population. As a last note, this tells us nothing about what this means in terms of what we wanted to find out. That is subject to subsequent analysis.","word_list":"let s say you have a normally distributed population with a mean of   and a standard deviation of    let s say you were to pull a sample from this population  because of random chance  you wouldn t always get a sample with a mean of    in fact  if you pulled many samples from the population  most of the sample means would not be    but you would get more samples close to   and less samples far away from    if you were to pull an infinite number of samples and plotted the means in each sample  you would find that the means would follow what is known as the t distribution \n\nnote  however  that pulling an infinite number of samples is obviously impossible  the t distribution is a theoretical distribution  and is used to determine the probability that a sample was drawn from a population  \n\nhere s a made up example as a demonstration  let s say you have tested the iq of   professors  and their mean iq was    the mean iq in the overall population of humans is    by definition   now you ask yourself  do professors on average have a higher iq than the overall population  to answer this  you estimate the probability that your data arose given that the opposite is true  namely that professors do not differ from the overall population in terms of iq  here s where the t distribution comes into play  remember when we pulled an infinite number of samples  and plotted them  remember how most of the samples were close to    that means that if our sample is sufficiently far away from    we can say that it s unlikely that we obtained our sample mean by pure chance  in our example  mean of    standard deviation of        of samples drawn would have an average iq of between   and    this means that it s fairly unlikely  less than    chance  that our data  with its mean of    was drawn from the same population as the overall population  as a last note  this tells us nothing about what this means in terms of what we wanted to find out  that is subject to subsequent analysis "}

{"author":"gschizas","body":"It is, yes :) I'm not sure your project really requires it though - it's quite simple.\n\nIn the spirit of improving your code and following [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), here are some more suggestions:\n\n1. Method names are supposed to be lower_case_with_underscores (aka snake_case), not CapitalizedWords (aka PascalCase/CamelCase) or even worse, mixedCase (this is only reserved for backwards compatibility).\n2. There is no reason for \"get\" - this is not Java :) Better use some more descriptive name, e.g. download_all() or download_random()\n3. Don't try to catch all exceptions, this is \n4. fetchJSON (or better yet, fetch_json or fetch_JSON, for PEP8 compliance, or something like comic_info_url to make a bit more sense) could be static - it doesn't use \"self\" at all. You could either make it a standalone function\n5. You don't need to do this: 'someformat{0}'.format(str(some_number)). Since you are using format, the \"str\" is useless - it's handled by the format function\n6. While on the case of format, you can also do this: 'someformat{}'.format(some_number), and will have the same result as 'someformat{0}'.format(some_number).\n7. Usage of magic numbers in code is frowned upon. Don't write \"0.083 * something\", make \"0.083\" into a constant and use that instead.\n8. os.makedirs has a parameter that effectively says \"don't worry if the path already exists\". So, instead of \"if not os.path.exists(self.download_dir): os.makedirs(self.download_dir)\", you can just write \"os.makedirs(self.download_dir, exist_ok=True)\"\n9. Also, instead of using print() to show debug messages, consider using the (quite nice) logging module - it allows you to redirect your logs to files (instead of the standard output), with just a few lines of configuration.\n10. Don't test paths for \"/\" - it doesn't work on Windows. Use os.path.sep instead.\n\nDon't take this the wrong way, this is a wonderful program that you made, and I'm stealing some of it for a personal project (I wanted to add a datestamp at picture taken from a security camera). I took a coursera class this autumn and it comes naturally to me.\n","word_list":"it is  yes    i m not sure your project really requires it though   it s quite simple \n\nin the spirit of improving your code and following  pep       here are some more suggestions \n\n   method names are supposed to be lower case with underscores  aka snake case   not capitalizedwords  aka pascalcase camelcase  or even worse  mixedcase  this is only reserved for backwards compatibility  \n   there is no reason for  get    this is not java    better use some more descriptive name  e g  download all   or download random  \n   don t try to catch all exceptions  this is \n   fetchjson  or better yet  fetch json or fetch json  for pep  compliance  or something like comic info url to make a bit more sense  could be static   it doesn t use  self  at all  you could either make it a standalone function\n   you don t need to do this   someformat      str some number    since you are using format  the  str  is useless   it s handled by the format function\n   while on the case of format  you can also do this   someformat     some number   and will have the same result as  someformat      some number  \n   usage of magic numbers in code is frowned upon  don t write        something   make       into a constant and use that instead \n     has a parameter that effectively says  don t worry if the path already exists   so  instead of  if not              you can just write       exist ok true  \n   also  instead of using print   to show debug messages  consider using the  quite nice  logging module   it allows you to redirect your logs to files  instead of the standard output   with just a few lines of configuration \n   don t test paths for       it doesn t work on windows  use   instead \n\ndon t take this the wrong way  this is a wonderful program that you made  and i m stealing some of it for a personal project  i wanted to add a datestamp at picture taken from a security camera   i took a coursera class this autumn and it comes naturally to me \n"}

Phi represents the number of relatively prime numbers less than 100. \n\nIt turns out the \"phi of 100\" is 40 (there are theorems that explain how to find phi of different numbers). \n\n* The exponent is 2014, and 2014 = 50*(phi of 100) + 14.\n\n\nUsing Euler's theorem, \n\n* 2014^2014 (mod 100) = (2014^(phi of 100))^50 * 2014^14 (mod 100) = 2014^14 (mod 100).\n\nSo now, all we have to do is find 2014^14 (mod 100), which is much simpler. To do this, we use the method of successive squares.\n\n\nIn 2014^14, the exponent is 14, 14 =  2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 = 8 + 4 + 2\n\n2014^1 mod 100 = 14\n\n2014^2 mod 100 = 14^2 = 96 \n\n2014^4 mod 100 = 96^2 = 16\n\n2014^8 mod 100 = 16^2 = 56 (remember, this is all in mod 100)\n\nSo,\n \n* 2014^14 = 2014^(8 + 4 +2) = 2014^8 * 2014^4 * 2014^2 = 56 * 16 * 96 (mod 100)\n\n56 * 16 * 96 = 16 mod 100.\n\n**The answer is 16**\n\nIf I had a calculator, I would use successive squares right away because I would not mind going up to 2^10. I only had to go up to 2^3 when I used Euler's theorem first. \n\nI'll be honest, I had to consult a number theory textbook to refresh my memory.

{"author":"ktbspa420","body":"oh man, that was so mean of you to turn off the automatic safety controls. Maybe someone in the plant will be fast enough to trip the turbine off before it flies apart. Some turbines would have tripped on overspeed if you hadn't turned all the safety trips off. Then it would, like, rupture somewhere in the turbine/steam pipes, and steam would go everywhere, and all the people in the space would die. I don't know about coal or anything, but if it's a nuclear plant like I am used to, and it wasn't scrammed yet when the steam rupture occurred, and it had a positive temperature coefficient of reactivity, the steam rupture would actually be like an increase in load, and power would go up. A lot. But maybe it was the kind I was used to, which would have scrammed when all the electricity turned off. Even though you disabled all the safety features, you probably wouldn't have been about to completely change the design of the control rod drives, which are held up by electromagnets, and automatically scram on loss of power due to both gravity and the pressure of a big ass spring. However, if you don't have any electricity, you don't have any pumps to cool the core, and even though it's shut down it's going to create heat for a while. If you have one of those super fancy ESBWR that I don't really know anything about, natural circulation will keep the core safe for a few days. More bad stuff is going to happen if we don't get steam suits on real quick and get some sort of emergency electric power to the pumps. But you turned off all the power plants, so there is no where to get power from. All the cores are going to melt down.

{"author":"DSMan195276","body":"&gt; You don't really understand the concept of rules, do you? They're completely fucking arbitrary. If you're so bound by rules then how about they just make \"Don't be a racist misogynistic piece of shit (hereafter referred to as RMPOS)\" to the rules? There you go! It's a precious fucking rule to whack off over.\n\n&gt; Rules mean nothing. \n\nI agree with you, they are for the most part completely arbitrary. That doesn't mean it's a good idea for Reddit to just apply Rules and random \"common sense\" anywhere and anywhy they want. They have rules so everybody gets treated the same, whether or not you're a holocaust denier or anybody else, and if you don't get treated the same you have a complete list of rules that you can point to and say \"Hey, you're not following the rules\". I don't think you understand anything about running a website as big as Reddit.\n\n&gt; Are you a child? Do you honestly think no conflict arises from disagreements over rules? Do you honestly think rules are always enforced correctly? Get a grip, dude.\n\nNo, and no I do not, and no I do not. But having written down rules allows you to do all of those things you mentioned. It's not hard to point and say \"This Reddit Admin did something not within the rules\" and that would be a legitimate complaint. The point is that when the rules are enforced correctly then people can't complain that they're being treated unfairly, and when they're not enforced correctly all you have to do is point at the rules and it's obvious. If you don't like what's in the rules then go ahead and talk to people and try to get new ones put in place. If they just start doing whatever they hell they want then there's no room to complain they're not following their rules and no way to argue when a Reddit Admin makes a mistake.\n\n&gt; I'm pretty sure most people would agree that an RMPOS running /r/holocaust[1] defies logic. \n\nThis one I honestly don't understand. Why is there any reason to say /r/holocaust can't be about holocaust denial? The name '/r/holocaust' is fairly generic, and even more so we have plenty of subreddits that exist that don't have perfect names (Ex. /r/trees). Perhaps it's a bit dumb but holocaust denial still has to do with the holocaust. I don't like it but it doesn't \"defy logic\", it was perfectly possible to happen. You just don't like it, but Reddit isn't run by you.\n\n&gt; Reddit (the company) likes to pretend to be \"hands off\" yet can, has, and will put the brakes on anything that manages to threaten them as a business.\n\nYes, because those things are usually illegal and will get all of Reddit taken down. There's a difference in scale here, the US government and other various entities don't care who's running /r/holocaust or what's in it, they *do* care that there's a subreddit called /r/jailbait that looks like it's a bunch of child-porn.","word_list":" gt  you don t really understand the concept of rules  do you  they re completely fucking arbitrary  if you re so bound by rules then how about they just make  don t be a racist misogynistic piece of shit  hereafter referred to as rmpos   to the rules  there you go  it s a precious fucking rule to whack off over \n\n gt  rules mean nothing  \n\ni agree with you  they are for the most part completely arbitrary  that doesn t mean it s a good idea for reddit to just apply rules and random  common sense  anywhere and anywhy they want  they have rules so everybody gets treated the same  whether or not you re a holocaust denier or anybody else  and if you don t get treated the same you have a complete list of rules that you can point to and say  hey  you re not following the rules   i don t think you understand anything about running a website as big as reddit \n\n gt  are you a child  do you honestly think no conflict arises from disagreements over rules  do you honestly think rules are always enforced correctly  get a grip  dude \n\nno  and no i do not  and no i do not  but having written down rules allows you to do all of those things you mentioned  it s not hard to point and say  this reddit admin did something not within the rules  and that would be a legitimate complaint  the point is that when the rules are enforced correctly then people can t complain that they re being treated unfairly  and when they re not enforced correctly all you have to do is point at the rules and it s obvious  if you don t like what s in the rules then go ahead and talk to people and try to get new ones put in place  if they just start doing whatever they hell they want then there s no room to complain they re not following their rules and no way to argue when a reddit admin makes a mistake \n\n gt  i m pretty sure most people would agree that an rmpos running  r holocaust    defies logic  \n\nthis one i honestly don t understand  why is there any reason to say  r holocaust can t be about holocaust denial  the name   r holocaust  is fairly generic  and even more so we have plenty of subreddits that exist that don t have perfect names  ex   r trees   perhaps it s a bit dumb but holocaust denial still has to do with the holocaust  i don t like it but it doesn t  defy logic   it was perfectly possible to happen  you just don t like it  but reddit isn t run by you \n\n gt  reddit  the company  likes to pretend to be  hands off  yet can  has  and will put the brakes on anything that manages to threaten them as a business \n\nyes  because those things are usually illegal and will get all of reddit taken down  there s a difference in scale here  the us government and other various entities don t care who s running  r holocaust or what s in it  they  do  care that there s a subreddit called  r jailbait that looks like it s a bunch of child porn "}
{"author":"[deleted]","body":"&gt;They have rules so everybody gets treated the same\n\nMy point being, they do NOT treat everyone the same. Their \"rules\" are selectively enforced all the time.\n\n&gt;when the rules are enforced correctly\n\nBy which interpretation? Ask one person and /r/jailbait was well within the guidelines. Ask another and it shouldn't have been created in the first place. \n\n&gt;If they just start doing whatever they hell they want then there's no room to complain they're not following their rules and no way to argue when a Reddit Admin makes a mistake.\n\nAnd how about the instances where mods and/or admins use those apparently inviolable rules to enforce their own policies? This is the problem with rules. No matter how airtight you make them there will always be some asshole or another there to exploit every hole they can find. That is why simply pointing to the rules and saying \"follow those\" does not work. That is why relying on rules to sort things out does not work.\n\nHell, just take a look at the FIA and their regulations for Formula 1. They're the most lawyer-fueled millimeter-fondling set of regulations for damn near anything... and they're STILL open to interpretation.\n\n&gt;Perhaps it's a bit dumb but holocaust denial still has to do with the holocaust. I don't like it but it doesn't \"defy logic\", it was perfectly possible to happen.\n\nBeing pedantic gets you nowhere. If you want to argue semantics then screw off. You yourself say you don't like it. That would put you in the category with the majority that find it complete bullshit, thereby reinforcing my point that most people would find it to be complete bullshit. You're arguing word choice, not the merit of my argument, which means you're running out of legs to stand on.\n\n&gt;but Reddit isn't run by you.\n\nNo, it's supposedly \"run\" by the majority. The up/down vote system is supposed to be a way to aggregate content that a majority want to see or find informative. Yet for some reason reddit doesn't apply this to moderation.\n\nWhy not?\n\nWhen the majority of people can clearly see that the moderator has nothing to do with the sub and is only using their status to enforce their opinion, therefore stifling the concept of \"free speech\" (which doesn't exist on a private website but people like to pretend does), WHAT RECOURSE DO THE USERS HAVE?\n\nWell, you can wait until they forget to log in for a few months.\n\nOther than that you're screwed.\n\n&gt;Yes, because those things are usually illegal and will get all of Reddit taken down.\n\nHolocaust denial is illegal in many countries. Marijuana use is illegal in most of the US. There are MANY subreddits dedicated to activities that are illegal in one place or another that could just as easily threaten reddit's existence. Several of the subs that violentacrez ran did not involve illegal content, even if they were morally reprehensible.\n\nBut they haven't been featured on the nightly news, now have they?\n\nIt's an absolute double standard. The admins of this site could easily provide more moderator oversight. That they choose not to while simultaneously banning people like violentacrez is hypocritical. They'll received dozens, if not hundreds, of complaints about abusive moderators but point to the rules and say \"Well, he's not really breaking any of those.\" The moment someone outside of reddit turns on the heat they completely change their mind and find some reason (usually \"rigging\") to get rid of everything questionable.\n\nIt's hypocrisy, plain and simple.

While this has many benefits the downside is we tend to over extend our theory of mind to inanimate or imaginary things.\n\nFor example, if a toaster burns our bread, we might say the toaster was mad at us. Or when people experience a hurricane and they could blame God for it.

{"author":"skeptic11","body":"&gt; Link flair isn't as easy to see as the comic number in the title.\n\nIt's likely good enough.\n\n&gt; Unless there's a way to make AutoModerator auto-tag them (which would require it to perform string functions on the URL, which I'm not sure it's capable of)\n\nNo idea.\n\n&gt; I would have to tag every single one with the comic number.\n\nWe're talking one or two posts a day. That seems manageable.\n\nThese are already posts that you were planning on deleting. How much work is it really going to be to flair them instead?\n\nAdditionally a flair'd post has educational value. When submitters see that posts without comic numbers get flair'd they can notice and it can dawn on them that there post should include a comic number. The educational value of deleting a post is smaller - only the submitter will ever see that moderator action has been taken.\n\n&gt; I understand that deleting the posts with large discussions in the comments will be bad\n\nAgain, we're seeing one or two posts a day on this subreddit. Based on that I'd take it further and say deleting ANY discussions on this subreddit will be harmful.\n\n&gt; but I hope that I'll find the submissions before discussion gets particularly large.\n\nHow many hours a day are you on Reddit? How quickly do you see things?\n\nBasicly this doesn't seem to me like something you as a single mod can constantly, timely keep on top of.\n\n&gt; If I give people passes just because they didn't know or forgot, they probably won't remember to do it next time.\n\nI disagree. See my point on education above.\n\n&gt; I know it's harsh at first, but there's no other way to make sure the rule is followed.\n\nI think you're hurting the subreddit.\n\nHaving comic numbers on threads would be nice. Deleting discussions on a small subreddit like this is horrible. I've suggested an alternative approach, I hope you'll consider it.","word_list":" gt  link flair isn t as easy to see as the comic number in the title \n\nit s likely good enough \n\n gt  unless there s a way to make automoderator auto tag them  which would require it to perform string functions on the url  which i m not sure it s capable of \n\nno idea \n\n gt  i would have to tag every single one with the comic number \n\nwe re talking one or two posts a day  that seems manageable \n\nthese are already posts that you were planning on deleting  how much work is it really going to be to flair them instead \n\nadditionally a flair d post has educational value  when submitters see that posts without comic numbers get flair d they can notice and it can dawn on them that there post should include a comic number  the educational value of deleting a post is smaller   only the submitter will ever see that moderator action has been taken \n\n gt  i understand that deleting the posts with large discussions in the comments will be bad\n\nagain  we re seeing one or two posts a day on this subreddit  based on that i d take it further and say deleting any discussions on this subreddit will be harmful \n\n gt  but i hope that i ll find the submissions before discussion gets particularly large \n\nhow many hours a day are you on reddit  how quickly do you see things \n\nbasicly this doesn t seem to me like something you as a single mod can constantly  timely keep on top of \n\n gt  if i give people passes just because they didn t know or forgot  they probably won t remember to do it next time \n\ni disagree  see my point on education above \n\n gt  i know it s harsh at first  but there s no other way to make sure the rule is followed \n\ni think you re hurting the subreddit \n\nhaving comic numbers on threads would be nice  deleting discussions on a small subreddit like this is horrible  i ve suggested an alternative approach  i hope you ll consider it "}

{"author":"XXCoreIII","body":"When this first started, activists were worried that national victories would result in a US constitutional amendment (which in turn would be practically unrepealable because it would only take 17 states to block the repeal, hello ex slave states).

When the public mindset changed in responses to these acts, cases based on the US constitution sprung up.\n\nNext up is the screwy way our appeals system is set up. At the first level, it applies to the state. At another level, it applies to a group of states, for SCOTUS, it applies to the whole country.

Since at present no appeals court has found in favor of the state (plus some SCOTUS internal politicking over what constitutes overreach, see the Scalia dissent of the DOMA case), SCOTUS turned the cases currently on appeal down. national decision will be made district by district from here, or even state by state if the states decide to chicken out and not appeal to save their neighbor states, until a judge actually rules in favor of a state, and makes a SCOTUS hearing necessary.","word_list":"when this first started  activists were worried that national victories would result in a us constitutional amendment  which in turn would be practically unrepealable because it would only take   states to block the repeal  hello ex slave states   the fight was contained to the state level  either that existing laws didn t specify man and woman  or getting the laws changed  all the stuff up until that last climb is on this level  when the public mindset changed in responses to these acts  cases based on the us constitution sprung up \n\nnext up is the screwy way our appeals system is set up  at the first level  it applies to the state  at another level  it applies to a group of states  for scotus  it applies to the whole country   there s also a court below scotus that can rule nationwide but has no jurisdiction here   it s also considered an abuse of power for scotus to hear a case in order to make it nationwide if all lower courts agree and they find themselves unlikely to disagree  since at present no appeals court has found in favor of the state  plus some scotus internal politicking over what constitutes overreach  see the scalia dissent of the doma case   scotus turned the cases currently on appeal down  national decision will be made district by district from here  or even state by state if the states decide to chicken out and not appeal to save their neighbor states  until a judge actually rules in favor of a state  and makes a scotus hearing necessary "}
