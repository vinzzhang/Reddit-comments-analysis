It also depends on what exactly you mean by a gene. Traditionally, the term gene refers to a region of DNA (or RNA depending on your system). In this case, DNA does not, on its own, control which proteins are made; proteins themselves can turn genes \"on\" or \"off\", sometimes permanently (this is what happens to stem cells when they become somatic cells).

{"author":"Primoris_Causa1","body":"&gt;The rockets we build being smaller than Saturn V says nothing about their relative merits. It certainly doesn't mean we've stopped innovating or that today's rockets aren't as good as the old ones.\n\nGranted.  Good and extremely valid argument.  That said, if we wanted to land someone on the moon ASAP today - we'd be dusting off 50+ yr old blueprints and try to replicate the Saturn V/Apollo combo with MAYBE a few MINOR safety/comfort updates that don't need further testing.\n\nCurrently, aside from what hanging in the Smithsonian, there are no man-rated craft rated much beyond LEO.  ATM.. we have .. uhm Soyuz and whatever the Chinese call their test craft.  Granted, SpaceX's Dragon is technically originally designed as a crew craft and was stripped for its robotic missions so revenue can come in while it works on man-rated certs -- and Orion just took its maiden flight Dec 5 so has a long way to go to even catch up to Dragon's track record.\n\nBeyond revisiting the moon though (maybe a close asteroid) - a long distance manned mission doesn't make sense with an Earth launch - launch from orbit  or moon sure ... travel time alone will necessitate adequate room for privacy/exercise/communal activities^1 - trip will be longer than longest stay in space so far -- and that was on the underpopulated MIR craft.  Not to mention the extra mass required to carry for basic radiation shielding and then the added shielding for safe room from intense flares.  Even with the shielding - the astronauts probably won't want to risk having offspring post-trip.\n\nTake all that mass into account, then add consumables and propellent... Earth launch cost prohibitive, ecologically disastrous and insane.  \n\nSo aside from a one-way trip with tiny crew at an enormous cost no one wants to pay (especially for the negligible return such a tiny crew could give) - don't expect anything until there are orbital construction facilities.\n\n^1 Unless we figure out hibernation/suspended animation - that could cut down on space and consumable needed until wake up - then you would still need all of it - just fewer consumables.","word_list":" gt the rockets we build being smaller than saturn v says nothing about their relative merits  it certainly doesn t mean we ve stopped innovating or that today s rockets aren t as good as the old ones \n\ngranted   good and extremely valid argument   that said  if we wanted to land someone on the moon asap today   we d be dusting off    yr old blueprints and try to replicate the saturn v apollo combo with maybe a few minor safety comfort updates that don t need further testing \n\ncurrently  aside from what hanging in the smithsonian  there are no man rated craft rated much beyond leo   atm   we have    uhm soyuz and whatever the chinese call their test craft   granted  spacex s dragon is technically originally designed as a crew craft and was stripped for its robotic missions so revenue can come in while it works on man rated certs    and orion just took its maiden flight dec   so has a long way to go to even catch up to dragon s track record \n\nbeyond revisiting the moon though  maybe a close asteroid    a long distance manned mission doesn t make sense with an earth launch   launch from orbit  or moon sure     travel time alone will necessitate adequate room for privacy exercise communal activities     trip will be longer than longest stay in space so far    and that was on the underpopulated mir craft   not to mention the extra mass required to carry for basic radiation shielding and then the added shielding for safe room from intense flares   even with the shielding   the astronauts probably won t want to risk having offspring post trip \n\ntake all that mass into account  then add consumables and propellent    earth launch cost prohibitive  ecologically disastrous and insane   \n\nso aside from a one way trip with tiny crew at an enormous cost no one wants to pay  especially for the negligible return such a tiny crew could give    don t expect anything until there are orbital construction facilities \n\n   unless we figure out hibernation suspended animation   that could cut down on space and consumable needed until wake up   then you would still need all of it   just fewer consumables "}

{"author":"sinndogg","body":"Actually, there are stars up to twice that distance from Earth that can be seen without binoculars or a telescope.  The most distant *bright* star (i.e. with an apparent magnitude lower than 1.5) is Deneb, which is thought to be about 2,600 ly away, but there are more distant stars that can be seen at least sometimes with the naked eye, like Eta Carinae (7,500-8,000 ly).  It's [highly variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_blue_variable), and it sometimes goes through quiescent phases where it drops below the threshold for naked eye visibility (i.e. an apparent magnitude of about 6.5), but it's been visible for the last few years now.  In fact, it was the second brightest star in the night sky for a while, when it underwent a supernova impostor event in the 1840s.\n\nAs for Andromeda, it's actually a bit larger than a point source (it looks like someone took a moderately bright star and smudged it), although it may look that way if you're looking at it under less-than-ideal conditions.  You can't see its spiral arms with the naked eye though, only the nucleus.\n\nEDIT: Accidentally said that Deneb was the nearest bright star, not the furthest.  Obviously not the case, since Alpha Centauri is obviously the closest bright star (and third brightest nighttime star overall, after Canopus and Sirius).","word_list":"actually  there are stars up to twice that distance from earth that can be seen without binoculars or a telescope   the most distant  bright  star  i e  with an apparent magnitude lower than      is deneb  which is thought to be about     ly away  but there are more distant stars that can be seen at least sometimes with the naked eye  like eta carinae          ly    it s  highly variable      and it sometimes goes through quiescent phases where it drops below the threshold for naked eye visibility  i e  an apparent magnitude of about       but it s been visible for the last few years now   in fact  it was the second brightest star in the night sky for a while  when it underwent a supernova impostor event in the  s \n\nas for andromeda  it s actually a bit larger than a point source  it looks like someone took a moderately bright star and smudged it   although it may look that way if you re looking at it under less than ideal conditions   you can t see its spiral arms with the naked eye though  only the nucleus \n\nedit  accidentally said that deneb was the nearest bright star  not the furthest   obviously not the case  since alpha centauri is obviously the closest bright star  and third brightest nighttime star overall  after canopus and sirius  "}

{"author":"Altair1371","body":"Ok, so protons have a positive charge and electrons have a negative charge, right?  Well, antimatter is where you have negative protons (called antiprotons, but I think they missed out on calling them negatrons) and positive electrons (called positrons).  The problem with antimatter is that if it collides with normal matter, it releases a ton of gamma rays and neutrinos.  This turns into a ton of energy.  So the problem with antimatter (and why it's so rare) is that it's really hard to collect and contain, since all containers are made of matter.  It's like trying to collect lava with a paper cup, you'll just end up with with an extremely dangerous mess.  At best, we can capture charged antiparticles with a combined magnetic and electric field, but the longest we could preserve an atom of antihydrogen was 17 minutes.\n\nAntimatter's got an extremely high energy density, so if you could collect and contain enough it would be a great option for rocket fuel.  The problem is that it's extremely hard to make antimatter right now, with estimates of $250 million per 10 mg.  \n\nSource: Wikipedia to confirm facts","word_list":"ok  so protons have a positive charge and electrons have a negative charge  right   well  antimatter is where you have negative protons  called antiprotons  but i think they missed out on calling them negatrons  and positive electrons  called positrons    the problem with antimatter is that if it collides with normal matter  it releases a ton of gamma rays and neutrinos   this turns into a ton of energy   so the problem with antimatter  and why it s so rare  is that it s really hard to collect and contain  since all containers are made of matter   it s like trying to collect lava with a paper cup  you ll just end up with with an extremely dangerous mess   at best  we can capture charged antiparticles with a combined magnetic and electric field  but the longest we could preserve an atom of antihydrogen was   minutes \n\nantimatter s got an extremely high energy density  so if you could collect and contain enough it would be a great option for rocket fuel   the problem is that it s extremely hard to make antimatter right now  with estimates of    million per   mg   \n\nsource  wikipedia to confirm facts"}

{"author":"MartinSchou","body":"&gt; By weight, the single most valuable thing that's been bought and sold on an open market is probably the Treskilling Yellow postage stamp. There's only one known copy of it, and in 2010 it sold for $2,300,000. That works out to about $30 billion per kilogram of stamps. If the Earth's weight were entirely postage stamps, it would still not be enough to pay off Au Bon Pain's potential debt.\n\nHe's not thinking about this properly. To solve this, I suggest we try to employ RIAA-maths. 1 song is worth $1.5 x 10^6 dollar. Let's use a 3 minute song as the norm. That's a 3 MB MP3 file. [SanDisk's 128 GB Micro SD card weighs just under 6 gram](http://www.sandisk.com/goto/newmicrosd128/), and it can store 42,600 3 MB MP3 files. That works out to 2.13 x 10^5 songs/gram for a total of 3.195 x 10^11 dollars/gram. That's a lot closer than the paltry 30 million/kg worth of stamps.\n\nIn fact, we only need 6.26 x 10^25 gram worth of MicroSD cards to achieve that. So, what has a mass of roughly 6 x 10^25 gram or 6 x 10^22 kg? Well, Earth is much to large. That's 6 ×10^24 kg. We need something that has a mass roughly 1% of Earth's.\n\nFortunately, [Wikipedia has a very useful list of Solar System objects](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Solar_System_objects_by_size). Europa (4.8 x 10^22 kg) is too small, but the Moon is plenty large, coming in at 7.35 x 10^22 kg.\n\nNow, as it happens, I happen to know that the middle section of the Moon (its core and so on) happens to be a giant memory storage unit, left behind by an ancient alien civilization. It stores nothing but original recordings of Clair de Lune.\n\nProblem solved.","word_list":" gt  by weight  the single most valuable thing that s been bought and sold on an open market is probably the treskilling yellow postage stamp  there s only one known copy of it  and in   it sold for         that works out to about    billion per kilogram of stamps  if the earth s weight were entirely postage stamps  it would still not be enough to pay off au bon pain s potential debt \n\nhe s not thinking about this properly  to solve this  i suggest we try to employ riaa maths    song is worth      x     dollar  let s use a   minute song as the norm  that s a   mb mp  file   sandisk s   gb micro sd card weighs just under   gram      and it can store       mb mp  files  that works out to     x     songs gram for a total of     x     dollars gram  that s a lot closer than the paltry   million kg worth of stamps \n\nin fact  we only need     x     gram worth of microsd cards to achieve that  so  what has a mass of roughly   x     gram or   x     kg  well  earth is much to large  that s   ×    kg  we need something that has a mass roughly    of earth s \n\nfortunately   wikipedia has a very useful list of solar system objects      europa      x     kg  is too small  but the moon is plenty large  coming in at     x     kg \n\nnow  as it happens  i happen to know that the middle section of the moon  its core and so on  happens to be a giant memory storage unit  left behind by an ancient alien civilization  it stores nothing but original recordings of clair de lune \n\nproblem solved "}

{"author":"jianadaren1","body":"The first problem is time/speed\n\nBetween the long distance and having to stop whenever someone wants to get on or off, as you add more floors they became increasingly inacessible, and eventually unusable. (travel time ∝ number of floors; limit of floor accessibility as travel time -&gt; ∞ = 0)\n\nA solution for this is to have \"express\" elevators that move at high speed and don't stop at lower floors. However, elevators take up a lot of space. The elevator takes up floor space in *every single floor* it accesses. So as you add more blocks of that require new express elevators, you increase your elevator requirement at the lower floors, thus reducing lower-floor space less. You can get to the point where the floor space eaten up by a new elevator would be more than the floor space it accesses. So that you'd actually be destroying floor-space as you add more floors.\n\nNet building floor space added per floor block = floor space for each new floor -(floor space of new elevator * number of floors)\n\nAll those elevator shafts eat up major floor space and the amount of floor space they eat up increases as the building increases in height. You could partially offset this by having multiple stops, but then you're back to your time/speed problem.\n\nTL;DR elevators are like vertical roads in a building; the taller the building, the higher the traffic and the more lanes you need, the more roads you need, eating up space that would otherwise be usable. Eventually the roads get so long that new floors require more space in new roads than they create by being floors: also, the bottom floors are pretty much all roads\n\n","word_list":"the first problem is time speed\n\nbetween the long distance and having to stop whenever someone wants to get on or off  as you add more floors they became increasingly inacessible  and eventually unusable   travel time ∝ number of floors  limit of floor accessibility as travel time   gt  ∞     \n\na solution for this is to have  express  elevators that move at high speed and don t stop at lower floors  however  elevators take up a lot of space  the elevator takes up floor space in  every single floor  it accesses  so as you add more blocks of that require new express elevators  you increase your elevator requirement at the lower floors  thus reducing lower floor space less  you can get to the point where the floor space eaten up by a new elevator would be more than the floor space it accesses  so that you d actually be destroying floor space as you add more floors \n\nnet building floor space added per floor block   floor space for each new floor   floor space of new elevator   number of floors \n\nall those elevator shafts eat up major floor space and the amount of floor space they eat up increases as the building increases in height  you could partially offset this by having multiple stops  but then you re back to your time speed problem \n\ntl dr elevators are like vertical roads in a building  the taller the building  the higher the traffic and the more lanes you need  the more roads you need  eating up space that would otherwise be usable  eventually the roads get so long that new floors require more space in new roads than they create by being floors  also  the bottom floors are pretty much all roads\n\n"}

They don't need to put themself out there. Males will approach them and all they need to do is accept or reject the offer. The worst thing that can happen In  terms of their self-esteem is that nobody makes an offer. I guess that sucks but such implicit rejection doen't happen in front of someone they've just made themselves vulnerable to.\n\nA male introvert however has two choices. 1) be alone forever, or 2) put themself out there and approach a female. This is a huge deal for a shy person. It takes every bit of will power they have. Rejection is the most likely outcome of this too. Far more likely for a shy male than an outgoing one. They will be nervous and that will be seen as weakness, a trait almost universally seen as repulsive in men.\n\nSo they make themselves vulnerable and get rejected. Unlike the case for the female, this is an explicit rejection and happens while they are facing the person they just made themself vulnerable to.\n\nThis is not the fault of the women.

{"author":"altrocks","body":"I dunno, how would you do if we dropped you in the middle of a foreign country where no one knows English? It's a completely different language you're talking about. We have a formal and standardized system of communication to use. If you want to be understood correctly, you need to encode your ideas correctly.\n\nHowever, to answer your question, yes, you need to comprehend nearly every word in a sentence to understand its meaning. One word can completely change the meaning of a sentence. When people write their/there/they're interchangeably, and it's not just an autocorrect oversight, what the reader sees is that the writer  **didn't actually know what they were writing**. You/ewe is a more striking example of this principle. They are phonetically identical, but differ when written in both spelling and meaning.\n\nSo when people \"write phonetically\" instead of following the rules of grammar, what they are conveying to everyone else is that they're faking literacy. If you don't think that matters, that's fine. It's not important for everyone to the same degree. However, as noted here, more and more communication is being done by writing in email, texts, status updates, posts, tweets, etc. If you want to be understood immediately in such media, you need to be clear with your message.\n\nYou can think of this as an analogy as well. When there were few roads and even fewer cars, all that mattered was that a person could operate their vehicle without causing damage to property or life. As more roads and cars came into being, and thus became common among all people, standardized rules had to be followed for safe and effective use of the roads. If you can drive a car, but can't pass the written driver's test, you don't get a license most places. The reason is that you have shown you lack an actual understanding of the rules of the road and/or proper operation of a motor vehicle. We don't have licensing for language, thankfully, but when you display that similar lack of understanding in the written medium, many if not most people see you as less credible and it gives your words less weight. Again, maybe that doesn't matter to you, but it's something to be aware of when discussing this subject.\n\nEdit: corrected a couple words.","word_list":"i dunno  how would you do if we dropped you in the middle of a foreign country where no one knows english  it s a completely different language you re talking about  we have a formal and standardized system of communication to use  if you want to be understood correctly  you need to encode your ideas correctly \n\nhowever  to answer your question  yes  you need to comprehend nearly every word in a sentence to understand its meaning  one word can completely change the meaning of a sentence  when people write their there they re interchangeably  and it s not just an autocorrect oversight  what the reader sees is that the writer    didn t actually know what they were writing    you ewe is a more striking example of this principle  they are phonetically identical  but differ when written in both spelling and meaning \n\nso when people  write phonetically  instead of following the rules of grammar  what they are conveying to everyone else is that they re faking literacy  if you don t think that matters  that s fine  it s not important for everyone to the same degree  however  as noted here  more and more communication is being done by writing in email  texts  status updates  posts  tweets  etc  if you want to be understood immediately in such media  you need to be clear with your message \n\nyou can think of this as an analogy as well  when there were few roads and even fewer cars  all that mattered was that a person could operate their vehicle without causing damage to property or life  as more roads and cars came into being  and thus became common among all people  standardized rules had to be followed for safe and effective use of the roads  if you can drive a car  but can t pass the written driver s test  you don t get a license most places  the reason is that you have shown you lack an actual understanding of the rules of the road and or proper operation of a motor vehicle  we don t have licensing for language  thankfully  but when you display that similar lack of understanding in the written medium  many if not most people see you as less credible and it gives your words less weight  again  maybe that doesn t matter to you  but it s something to be aware of when discussing this subject \n\nedit  corrected a couple words "}

This implies doing what is best for future generations above all else.\n\nI agree that agency is important, but I'd argue that it is important because it is a means to an end. It is important to develop one's own character for the same reason it is important to raise your children well, and the same reason it is important to give people who are down on their luck a chance to develop themselves. In practice, it is generally easier to develop one’s own mind than to help others develop their minds, but there are a few important exceptions. Some people (authors, religious figures, leaders of cultural movements, etc) find themselves in a position to make a small improvement in our entire culture. The *simple* ideas spread by people like Martin Luther King Jr and Gandhi have much greater net benefit than any *larger* improvements they could have made to their own character.\n\nThe counterpoint to this view is something called \"virtue ethics\". Basically, it's the idea that the world is too complicated to be able to find any universal goals. Instead, the best you can do is to pick certain virtues (either because you lack them or because you want to improve them) and work to develop yourself as a person.

{"author":"djimbob","body":"You are confusing things.  \n\nYes, OpenSSL has its own malloc, but that's irrelevant.^1 \n\n[Process isolation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_isolation) is achieved in modern OSes, as the OS only provides each running process (e.g., nginx) access to its own virtual memory space, so its impossible for a bug in nginx to address (let alone read or write) physical memory that wasn't given to it.  That is when a process says I'm reading memory on a pointer to `0x0326a310` that isn't an address of a byte of physical memory, it's in a virtual address space unique to that process.  If another process tries reading `0x0326a310` its meaningless; that page more likely than won't translate to any physical address in a different process. The OS assigns pages (large chunks) of memory to processes as necessary and does the translation between virtual address space and physical memory addresses without giving applications any method to directly access physical memory or the memory of other processes (unless you specifically set aside pages to be shared via interprocess communication -- but again you have to go out of your way to do that).\n\n&amp;nbsp;^1  The point of its own malloc is the scheme for how memory allocation happens.  When does OpenSSL ask the OS for more pages of memory?  How does it split up those pages of memory?  How does it mark a section of memory used and how does it mark it as free to be allocated to some other variable?

{"author":"TM3Sb","body":"&gt;\"Does the electrolytic fluid that(as I understand it) exists between the neurons build and retain an electron charge after excessive or continuous use?\"...\n\nShort answer: No\n\nThe movement of charge is across membranes, usually within only the neuron that is firing. Maybe localized to the abutting/contacting glia. Channels open and close that allow sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sometimes chloride ions to cross the membranes along the electro-chemical gradients that have been established by active ion pumps. Each cells is constantly resetting the transmembrane electrochemical potential. The movement of electrical charge over space is a bit of a misnomer. It's adjacent voltage gated channels opening and then closing with a bit of a refractory period that allows for coherent waves of depolarization to \"flow\" along neuronal cell bodies.\n\nThe whole neurons as wires concept needs to be dropped. They're more transducers and small computational units. Chemical input -&gt; integration at soma-&gt; action potentials that vary in frequency and amplitutde -&gt; chemical release at synapse. This is combined with alterations in cellular homeostasis in each neuron and the surrounding glia that may include regulation at the level of protein localization, expression, gene regulation and even long term epigenetic changes.\n\n","word_list":" gt  does the electrolytic fluid that as i understand it  exists between the neurons build and retain an electron charge after excessive or continuous use     \n\nshort answer  no\n\nthe movement of charge is across membranes  usually within only the neuron that is firing  maybe localized to the abutting contacting glia  channels open and close that allow sodium  potassium  calcium  magnesium and sometimes chloride ions to cross the membranes along the electro chemical gradients that have been established by active ion pumps  each cells is constantly resetting the transmembrane electrochemical potential  the movement of electrical charge over space is a bit of a misnomer  it s adjacent voltage gated channels opening and then closing with a bit of a refractory period that allows for coherent waves of depolarization to  flow  along neuronal cell bodies \n\nthe whole neurons as wires concept needs to be dropped  they re more transducers and small computational units  chemical input   gt  integration at soma  gt  action potentials that vary in frequency and amplitutde   gt  chemical release at synapse  this is combined with alterations in cellular homeostasis in each neuron and the surrounding glia that may include regulation at the level of protein localization  expression  gene regulation and even long term epigenetic changes \n\n"}

Unless you launch the golf balls fast enough to escape the gravity of the bag of golf balls, you aren't doing anything.\n\nFor example, with a bag of golf balls 100 billion miles across, escape velocity would be about 250c. It can't be done (hence why he mentioned the bag of golf balls would form a black hole). For a bag the size of the distance from the Sun to Mars, escape velocity would be around 3 million miles per hour. So Tiger Woods, too, couldn't send a 200kg spaceship from Earth orbit to the Moon by hitting golf balls off it. With a bag the size of the Earth, escape velocity is \"only\" 14k miles per hour. Still too fast.\n\nHis potato cannon example is actually getting close to break-even. Escape velocity is about 250 miles an hour, and they are ejected at 310 miles an hour, so at least we actually get *some* momentum from the hit; we can move the spaceship. \n\nExcept we still aren't going to get to the moon, because the ultimate exhaust velocity of 60 mph means we are only being pushed 1/5 as hard as we expected without worrying about gravity. We'd need a bigger bag of golf balls to have enough \"fuel,\" which increases gravity and... well, you get the idea. The 310-mph potato cannon isn't gonna get us there either.\n\nBut if you can get a little more kick, you can make it work.

{"author":"dgerard","body":"From Roko's original post:\n\n&gt;In this vein, there is the ominous possibility that if a positive singularity does occur, the resultant singleton may have precommitted to punish all potential donors who knew about existential risks but who didn't give 100% of their disposable incomes to x-risk motivation. This would act as an incentive to get people to donate more to reducing existential risk, and thereby increase the chances of a positive singularity.\n\nThe \"punishment\" is of another copy of you. The whole point of Roko's post is a scheme to get out of this punishment by having a copy of you in another Everett branch win the lottery, thus having money to donate.\n\nThus, I think it's fair to call it pretty darn important.

{"author":"escape_goat","body":"There are 25 known* subatomic particles in typographic chemistry.  All elements have at least one letter and one *shift*.  The shift particle cannot be detected directly, but its properties can be inferred from differences in the kerning force between 'simple' atoms and their subatomic homochars.  No element has more than one shift particle.  As shift particles cannot be detected, their existence was for a long time a question of great controversy.  However, as the messages exchanged in the debate became more heated, statistical anomalies in the frequency of appearance of 'simple' atoms were eventually proven to be the result of an uneven distribution of shift particles.  A controversial alternate theory, that of the CAPS field, still has a few adherents.\n\nWhen sufficient energy is imparted to a 'Ni' atom, it will break into the shift particle, as well as the subatomic 'n' and 'i' particles.  Except under the most extreme conditions, the shift particle will invariably join with one of the two particles to form the element 'N' or the element 'I'.  The other particle will usually join with a free shift particle shortly thereafter;  however, more complex atomic interactions are possible.  For instance, Nickel-Aluminum cross-fusion was discovered quite early by nuclear physicists, yielding Lithium and Sodium:   ' Ni + Al + .'  ==&gt;  ' Li + Na '.\n\n\\**A 'j' particle has never been detected, although it could exist in theory;  likewise, there is a hypothetical 'q' particle that one would infer from the sequence of subatomic particles, but due to the laws of grammar it would only be able to form the element 'Qu';  when the so-called element 'Uuq' is actually discovered, if it exists, it will be called 'Qu' (rather than 'Uq') and allow us to make detailed measurements of the transitive energy of the shift particle for the first time.*\n\n---\n ^[edit: ^I ^wish ^to ^express ^my ^profound ^gratitude ^for ^the ^reddit ^gold.]","word_list":"there are   known  subatomic particles in typographic chemistry   all elements have at least one letter and one  shift    the shift particle cannot be detected directly  but its properties can be inferred from differences in the kerning force between  simple  atoms and their subatomic homochars   no element has more than one shift particle   as shift particles cannot be detected  their existence was for a long time a question of great controversy   however  as the messages exchanged in the debate became more heated  statistical anomalies in the frequency of appearance of  simple  atoms were eventually proven to be the result of an uneven distribution of shift particles   a controversial alternate theory  that of the caps field  still has a few adherents \n\nwhen sufficient energy is imparted to a  ni  atom  it will break into the shift particle  as well as the subatomic  n  and  i  particles   except under the most extreme conditions  the shift particle will invariably join with one of the two particles to form the element  n  or the element  i    the other particle will usually join with a free shift particle shortly thereafter   however  more complex atomic interactions are possible   for instance  nickel aluminum cross fusion was discovered quite early by nuclear physicists  yielding lithium and sodium      ni   al          gt     li   na   \n\n   a  j  particle has never been detected  although it could exist in theory   likewise  there is a hypothetical  q  particle that one would infer from the sequence of subatomic particles  but due to the laws of grammar it would only be able to form the element  qu    when the so called element  uuq  is actually discovered  if it exists  it will be called  qu   rather than  uq   and allow us to make detailed measurements of the transitive energy of the shift particle for the first time  \n\n   \n   edit   i  wish  to  express  my  profound  gratitude  for  the  reddit  gold  "}

{"author":"colossusden","body":"The way natural selection works is the creature that survives will live on to keep reproducing itself. That plant had a shape that looked kind of like a bee, and the most successful members of that particular plant species had a flower that looked the most like a bee.

{"author":"Wyboth","body":"&gt;We're talking one or two posts a day. That seems manageable.\n\nEvery day, for the rest of my life. I understand that it seems insignificant, but it will become incredibly annoying the longer I have to do it.\n\n&gt;These are already posts that you were planning on deleting. How much work is it really going to be to flair them instead?\n\nThey'd even out. I'd have to go out to xkcd.com to see what comic number it is, then click the flair button, type in the comic number, and hit save. Alternatively, I would leave a comment informing them of the rule and remove it.\n\n&gt;Additionally a flair'd post has educational value. When submitters see that posts without comic numbers get flair'd they can notice and it can dawn on them that there post should include a comic number. The educational value of deleting a post is smaller - only the submitter will ever see that moderator action has been taken.\n\nBuuut, if a submitter goes to the frontpage and sees that all comic posts follow the \"xkcd ####:\" format, it will be even more obvious that he or she needs to submit with that format. Moreover, I can add the rule to the submission text. I think that's more obvious than flair.\n\n&gt;Again, we're seeing one or two posts a day on this subreddit. Based on that I'd take it further and say deleting ANY discussions on this subreddit will be harmful.\n\nBut, if I don't enforce the rule, then maybe half of the submissions will follow it, and that would defeat the purpose of having the rule (since users still would not be able to tell which comics are new and which are old). Deleting discussions hurts. I get it. I have to choose between the lesser of two evils here, (maybe) having to delete a few discussions early on to get the ball rolling, or abandon the rule. I think the second is the greater evil. *Hopefully* everyone will see the new rule and I won't have to remove anything.\n\n&gt;How many hours a day are you on Reddit? How quickly do you see things?\n\n&gt;Basicly this doesn't seem to me like something you as a single mod can constantly, timely keep on top of.\n\nI'm on about 4-5 hours daily. The first thing I check is this sub and its modqueue. I understand that I can't be on all the time to delete these posts. I'm going to try my best to catch them before they get too big.\n\n&gt;I think you're hurting the subreddit.\n\n&gt;Having comic numbers on threads would be nice. Deleting discussions on a small subreddit like this is horrible. I've suggested an alternative approach, I hope you'll consider it.\n\nWe'll see. I'll try my method for a week.

{"author":"dont_press_ctrl-W","body":"It will HAVE to be an issue. And don't be too confident as to whether you'll side with the progressists or the conservatives on it. Be cautious about thinking that the issues of the future will just recapitulate the issues of the past.\n\nThe robot rights issue will be more complex than we think, because when we have intelligent robots, we'll also be able to build an uninterupted continuum from the intelligent robots down to your vaccum. In fact it would make sense to equip most regular machines with some modest amount of intelligence so they can perform their task better. So where do we draw the line between which machines have rights and which don't?\n\nYou might think some measure of intelligence will have to be used for machines, but that wouldn't be fair since we don't use a similar definition for humans: people don't lose their basic rights for having brain-damage or for being in a coma. The robots could argue that if your brain-dead aunt has basic rights, then why wouldn't vaccum cleaners? \n\nEven if the continuum argument doesn't sway you, you should see that there is an ethical problem to a legal system where rights depend on a threshold that one group can control in the other. If a threshold X is chosen for AI rights, humans could just build machines that fall just short of the threshold or circumvent it in some way so that they can still have they intelligent-ish slaves. \n\nThis is a similar problem to those of a \"voter's test\" where voters need to prove sufficient knowledge in order to vote: it has the problem that the group who can vote can also control the non-voters' access to the knowledge that they would need to even start voting, and they can't vote this access for themselves since they can't pass the test. If humans have control over machines' access to intelligence level, then it's a problem to make intelligence level part of what makes machines have rights\n\nSo there is a possibility that the machine right issue will not just be about calling Data-like androids \"persons\" and letting them get married. There might be a point where our entire relationship with machines will need to be reconsidered. There might be a camp calling for the abolition of using machines as objects altogether. This is a radical view, but I think a very plausible one.\n\nThe issues of the future will not necessarily be as isomorphic to the ones of the past, and no one should presume that you'll always be on the progressive side of them.","word_list":"it will have to be an issue  and don t be too confident as to whether you ll side with the progressists or the conservatives on it  be cautious about thinking that the issues of the future will just recapitulate the issues of the past \n\nthe robot rights issue will be more complex than we think  because when we have intelligent robots  we ll also be able to build an uninterupted continuum from the intelligent robots down to your vaccum  in fact it would make sense to equip most regular machines with some modest amount of intelligence so they can perform their task better  so where do we draw the line between which machines have rights and which don t \n\nyou might think some measure of intelligence will have to be used for machines  but that wouldn t be fair since we don t use a similar definition for humans  people don t lose their basic rights for having brain damage or for being in a coma  the robots could argue that if your brain dead aunt has basic rights  then why wouldn t vaccum cleaners  \n\neven if the continuum argument doesn t sway you  you should see that there is an ethical problem to a legal system where rights depend on a threshold that one group can control in the other  if a threshold x is chosen for ai rights  humans could just build machines that fall just short of the threshold or circumvent it in some way so that they can still have they intelligent ish slaves  \n\nthis is a similar problem to those of a  voter s test  where voters need to prove sufficient knowledge in order to vote  it has the problem that the group who can vote can also control the non voters  access to the knowledge that they would need to even start voting  and they can t vote this access for themselves since they can t pass the test  if humans have control over machines  access to intelligence level  then it s a problem to make intelligence level part of what makes machines have rights\n\nso there is a possibility that the machine right issue will not just be about calling data like androids  persons  and letting them get married  there might be a point where our entire relationship with machines will need to be reconsidered  there might be a camp calling for the abolition of using machines as objects altogether  this is a radical view  but i think a very plausible one \n\nthe issues of the future will not necessarily be as isomorphic to the ones of the past  and no one should presume that you ll always be on the progressive side of them "}

{"author":"albinobluesheep","body":"Wasn't there a story of a flight test pilot, I think it was a black bird too, where a few plains in the area are doing alt/speed checks with a local tower, and the black bird chimes in?\n\nEdit: [found it](http://oppositelock.jalopnik.com/favorite-sr-71-story-1079127041)\n\n*I don't know of any ludicrous speeding tickets so I can't participate in today's QOTD, but it did remind me of my favorite SR-71 story.*\n\n*This is an expanded excerpt from Brian Schul's book Sled Driver : Flying the World's Fastest Jet. (which happens to be out of print and ludicrously expensive now, I wish I had bought a copy when I could have afforded it).*\n\n\n&gt;There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.\n\n&gt;It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.\n\n&gt;I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.\n\n&gt;Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.\n\n&gt;We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: \"November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.\"\n\n&gt;Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the \" Houston Center voice.\" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.\n\n&gt;Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. \"I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed.\" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. \"Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check\". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: \"Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.\"\n\n&gt;And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.\n\n&gt;Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: \"Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?\" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. \"Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.\"\n\n&gt;I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: \"Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.\"\n\n&gt;For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, \"Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.\"\n\n&gt;It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.\n\n&gt;For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.","word_list":"wasn t there a story of a flight test pilot  i think it was a black bird too  where a few plains in the area are doing alt speed checks with a local tower  and the black bird chimes in \n\nedit   found it    \n\n i don t know of any ludicrous speeding tickets so i can t participate in today s qotd  but it did remind me of my favorite sr   story  \n\n this is an expanded excerpt from brian schul s book sled driver   flying the world s fastest jet   which happens to be out of print and ludicrously expensive now  i wish i had bought a copy when i could have afforded it   \n\n\n gt there were a lot of things we couldn t do in an sr    but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact  people often asked us if  because of this fact  it was fun to fly the jet  fun would not be the first word i would use to describe flying this plane  intense  maybe  even cerebral  but there was one day in our sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there  at least for a moment \n\n gt it occurred when walt and i were flying our final training sortie  we needed   hours in the jet to complete our training and attain mission ready status  somewhere over colorado we had passed the century mark  we had made the turn in arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly  my gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves  not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months  ripping across the barren deserts     feet below us  i could already see the coast of california from the arizona border  i was  finally  after many humbling months of simulators and study  ahead of the jet \n\n gt i was beginning to feel a bit sorry for walter in the back seat  there he was  with no really good view of the incredible sights before us  tasked with monitoring four different radios  this was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions  when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital  it had been difficult  too  for me to relinquish control of the radios  as during my entire flying career i had controlled my own transmissions  but it was part of the division of duties in this plane and i had adjusted to it  i still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground  however  walt was so good at many things  but he couldn t match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios  a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading  he understood that and allowed me that luxury \n\n gt just to get a sense of what walt had to contend with  i pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him  the predominant radio chatter was from los angeles center  far below us  controlling daily traffic in their sector  while they had us on their scope  albeit briefly   we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace \n\n gt we listened as the shaky voice of a lone cessna pilot asked center for a readout of his ground speed  center replied   november charlie    i m showing you at ninety knots on the ground  \n\n gt now the thing to understand about center controllers  was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a cessna  or to air force one  they always spoke in the exact same  calm  deep  professional  tone that made one feel important  i referred to it as the   houston center voice   i have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country s space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the houston controllers  that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that  and that they basically did  and it didn t matter what sector of the country we would be flying in  it always seemed like the same guy was talking  over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere  conversely  over the years  pilots always wanted to ensure that  when transmitting  they sounded like chuck yeager  or at least like john wayne  better to die than sound bad on the radios \n\n gt just moments after the cessna s inquiry  a twin beech piped up on frequency  in a rather superior tone  asking for his ground speed   i have you at one hundred and twenty five knots of ground speed   boy  i thought  the beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his cessna brethren  then out of the blue  a navy f   pilot out of nas lemoore came up on frequency  you knew right away it was a navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios   center  dusty   ground speed check   before center could reply  i m thinking to myself  hey  dusty   has a ground speed indicator in that million dollar cockpit  so why is he asking center for a readout  then i got it  ol  dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from mount whitney to the mojave knows what true speed is  he s the fastest dude in the valley today  and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new hornet  and the reply  always with that same  calm  voice  with more distinct alliteration than emotion   dusty    center  we have you at   on the ground  \n\n gt and i thought to myself  is this a ripe situation  or what  as my hand instinctively reached for the mic button  i had to remind myself that walt was in control of the radios  still  i thought  it must be done   in mere seconds we ll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost  that hornet must die  and die now  i thought about all of our sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming  i was torn \n\n gt somewhere    miles above arizona  there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet  then  i heard it  the click of the mic button from the back seat  that was the very moment that i knew walter and i had become a crew  very professionally  and with no emotion  walter spoke   los angeles center  aspen    can you give us a ground speed check   there was no hesitation  and the replay came as if was an everyday request   aspen    i show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty two knots  across the ground  \n\n gt i think it was the forty two knots that i liked the best  so accurate and proud was center to deliver that information without hesitation  and you just knew he was smiling  but the precise point at which i knew that walt and i were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say  in his most fighter pilot like voice   ah  center  much thanks  we re showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money  \n\n gt for a moment walter was a god  and we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the houston center voice  when   back with   roger that aspen  your equipment is probably more accurate than ours  you boys have a good one  \n\n gt it all had lasted for just moments  but in that short  memorable sprint across the southwest  the navy had been flamed  all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the king of speed  and more importantly  walter and i had crossed the threshold of being a crew  a fine day s work  we never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast \n\n gt for just one day  it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there "}

{"author":"AnythingApplied","body":"I wouldn't say so, but it depends on your definitions.  If you held a shouting contest and asked a panel of trained judges to be as objective as possible and vote for the person they perceived as the loudest, you aren't going to get the most \"liked, admired, or supported\", you're going to get the person perceived to be the loudest.  But that is a bit of a contrived example, as many votes do boil down to popularity contests, and even in my example it could be argued that the judges are \"supporting the loudest\" so the winner could be considered \"popularly loud among judges\".\n\nIn my mind, votes can become less like popularity contests if you:\n\n* Give voters a specific criteria they should measure their choices by such as most influential book, book you found most entertaining, most informative, most factually sound, or give ratings from 1 to 10 on various specific categories.  This gets away from generic \"most liked\".\n* Find voters that are able to objectively measure the criteria such as a panel of judges, critics, limit to people that have read all the books, or frame the poll in a way that encourages objectivity.  This makes sure that judges aren't straying from the criteria and staying away from just defaulting to \"most liked\".\n\nAnyway, the fact that it was only a popularity contest was only one of my objections, and I accepted that they didn't really attempt to avoid that outcome.  My main objection is that we're intentionally distorting the audience away from a representative sample of goodreads readers and into an audience that is skewed towards reddit users.  If \"What If\" wins, it will no longer means that it is the most popular nonfiction book among goodreads because of our distortion.  Not that they've really made an attempt to properly sample their users, so they probably don't mind this kind of attention, since that is probably the reasons for polls like these.","word_list":"i wouldn t say so  but it depends on your definitions   if you held a shouting contest and asked a panel of trained judges to be as objective as possible and vote for the person they perceived as the loudest  you aren t going to get the most  liked  admired  or supported   you re going to get the person perceived to be the loudest   but that is a bit of a contrived example  as many votes do boil down to popularity contests  and even in my example it could be argued that the judges are  supporting the loudest  so the winner could be considered  popularly loud among judges  \n\nin my mind  votes can become less like popularity contests if you \n\n  give voters a specific criteria they should measure their choices by such as most influential book  book you found most entertaining  most informative  most factually sound  or give ratings from   to   on various specific categories   this gets away from generic  most liked  \n  find voters that are able to objectively measure the criteria such as a panel of judges  critics  limit to people that have read all the books  or frame the poll in a way that encourages objectivity   this makes sure that judges aren t straying from the criteria and staying away from just defaulting to  most liked  \n\nanyway  the fact that it was only a popularity contest was only one of my objections  and i accepted that they didn t really attempt to avoid that outcome   my main objection is that we re intentionally distorting the audience away from a representative sample of goodreads readers and into an audience that is skewed towards reddit users   if  what if  wins  it will no longer means that it is the most popular nonfiction book among goodreads because of our distortion   not that they ve really made an attempt to properly sample their users  so they probably don t mind this kind of attention  since that is probably the reasons for polls like these "}

{"author":"OBOSOB","body":"&gt;\"That midterm figuratively killed me\" \n\nNo, however people would say things like \"that midterm killed me\" the figurative nature is implied because unless they just got resurrected, it didn't happen.\n\nNow, that is kind of fine if the statement is \"that midterm literally killed me\" because the same applies, it may make semantic pedants (guilty as charged) squirm but it does not impede understanding, it's clearly figurative due to context: they aren't dead.\n\nBut some people do say stuff \"I saw a massive spider and I *literally* shat myself\". Now we are dealing with either a delicate, embarrassing confession or, still more likely, they are figuratively exaggerating. So context, including social context and the type of language you expect of the speaker, should help here. Likelihood is they are using it figuratively, but then how *do* I make a literal statement and have it interpreted that way? Again, context is helpful but unambiguous language is clearer.\n\nWe're not all literally doomed by the loss of some amount of absolute expression but it is certainly not helpful to communication, especially in written form with someone we don't know, in some contexts. I'm sure better examples exist than my shitting oneself example. Formality is going to be a helpful contextual measure of course.\n\nI don't think you can dismiss the semantic challenge posed by a loss of clarity completely but it's important to not overstate it as many do.\n\nOverstatements will literally destroy communication irrecoverably.","word_list":" gt  that midterm figuratively killed me  \n\nno  however people would say things like  that midterm killed me  the figurative nature is implied because unless they just got resurrected  it didn t happen \n\nnow  that is kind of fine if the statement is  that midterm literally killed me  because the same applies  it may make semantic pedants  guilty as charged  squirm but it does not impede understanding  it s clearly figurative due to context  they aren t dead \n\nbut some people do say stuff  i saw a massive spider and i  literally  shat myself   now we are dealing with either a delicate  embarrassing confession or  still more likely  they are figuratively exaggerating  so context  including social context and the type of language you expect of the speaker  should help here  likelihood is they are using it figuratively  but then how  do  i make a literal statement and have it interpreted that way  again  context is helpful but unambiguous language is clearer \n\nwe re not all literally doomed by the loss of some amount of absolute expression but it is certainly not helpful to communication  especially in written form with someone we don t know  in some contexts  i m sure better examples exist than my shitting oneself example  formality is going to be a helpful contextual measure of course \n\ni don t think you can dismiss the semantic challenge posed by a loss of clarity completely but it s important to not overstate it as many do \n\noverstatements will literally destroy communication irrecoverably "}
