{"author":"_ayli_","body":"Because I was bored...\n\nFrom http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Columbiformes_by_population, counting species that number 1mil+, we get an estimated total population of somewhere in the 500-600mil range. http://www.ask.com/question/how-many-pigeons-are-there-in-the-world gives an estimate of 400mil, so let's go with 500mil. Wikipedia gives the rock pigeon weight as around 11oz. Taking them as the average pigeon, this gives an estimated pigeon biomass of about 140000 metric tons. So pigeons don't rate even a single box on the chart (you'd need about 7-8x the number of pigeons to get one box).\n\nGetting population numbers for rats is more difficult. I found http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090915125805AAJmXEN, which estimates 1 rat per 36 people in NYC in 1949, and http://www.mphonline.org/most-rat-infested-cities-in-the-western-world/ which says NYC is most infested (but sadly does not give numbers). If we go with that, and Wikipedia's figure of about 200g per black rat, that gives us a global estimate of about 40 metric tons, which also doesn't rate even a single box.\n\nBonus:\n\nVarious sources put the number of cats at up to a billion. This is consistent with the US population and number of cat pets. The actual number could be higher if the rest of the world has a higher per-capita feral cat population. Assuming a billion cats and 10lbs per cat, this gives us a total cat biomass of 4.5 million tons - this definitely warrants at least four boxes, and I'm surprised cats aren't featured on the comic!","word_list":"because i was bored   \n\nfrom    counting species that number  mil   we get an estimated total population of somewhere in the    mil range    gives an estimate of  mil  so let s go with  mil  wikipedia gives the rock pigeon weight as around  oz  taking them as the average pigeon  this gives an estimated pigeon biomass of about   metric tons  so pigeons don t rate even a single box on the chart  you d need about    x the number of pigeons to get one box  \n\ngetting population numbers for rats is more difficult  i found    which estimates   rat per   people in nyc in    and   which says nyc is most infested  but sadly does not give numbers   if we go with that  and wikipedia s figure of about  g per black rat  that gives us a global estimate of about   metric tons  which also doesn t rate even a single box \n\nbonus \n\nvarious sources put the number of cats at up to a billion  this is consistent with the us population and number of cat pets  the actual number could be higher if the rest of the world has a higher per capita feral cat population  assuming a billion cats and  lbs per cat  this gives us a total cat biomass of     million tons   this definitely warrants at least four boxes  and i m surprised cats aren t featured on the comic "}

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"They're not based on being anti-PUA, they're anti-PUA either due to various factors of their readership and/or moderator policies. The only one I see that's arguably *based* on being anti-PUA is /r/TheBluePill. I'm considering being based on being anti-PUA, and being anti-PUA as a coincidence of the subreddit two different things; based on being anti-PUA would mean that the sub's main subject matter is talking about how terrible PUAs are. Let me do a rundown of x-posts I found by [searching this comic's URL](http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fxkcd.com%2F1325%2F):\n\n* /r/TwoXCromosomes: subject matter is just being a woman, and most subscribers are (supposedly) women. They'll be anti-PUA because... well... I'm just gonna say if you find a group of women (or... probably any sufficiently large group of people) and ask them \"what do you think about pick up artists\" they'll say that PUAs are pigs and awful people. Anti-PUA, but not anti-PUA based.\n\n* /r/Feminism: I don't need to explain this do I? Of course they're anti-PUA but the sub wasn't started to fight PUAs. Anti-PUA, but not anti-PUA based.\n\n* /r/AgainstMensRights: Not based on being anti-PUA, but based on being anti /r/MensRights... whose members seem to have a tendency towards pro-PUA. Anti-PUA, but not anti-PUA based.\n\n* /r/TrollXCromosomes: See /r/TwoXCromosomes.\n\n* /r/GeekFeminists: see /r/Feminism. \n\n* /r/SRSFunny and /r/SRSComics: If you're unfamiliar with the SRS Fempire, they exist to point out the various displays of isms on reddit. They behave like Tumblr SJWs, but whether or not they hold the views they preach is never quite so easy to say for sure. Anyway, misogyny is they're big one, and I think that if PUAs want to refer to women as HB(1-10) (e.g. HB8 means \"girl who's an 8 out of 10\"), I think that the Fempire is gonna take issue. Anti-PUA, but not anti-PUA based\n\n* /r/MensRights: I guess this could be pro-PUA? It shouldn't be but I've heard that there is a fair amount of pro-PUA sentiment there. I'll call them neutral. \n\n* /r/TheRedPill: Alright, there's the pro-PUA one.\n\nAnd the rest pretty much go on to be PUA neutral, or anti-PUA but not based on being anti-PUA. \n\nSo, I see 8 maybe 9 you can call anti-PUA, one you can call based on being anti-PUA, and one you can call pro-PUA.\n\nTL;DR: Word choice matters, and Adderall is one helluva drug.

Strength, it was noted in the comic that massive building collapse under their own weight. The same goes for the space elevator, we just don't have materials strong enough to build the thing out of.\n\n2.

Whether he chooses to move forward on this or not is up to him, though.\n\nThe spirit of the law is an issue here too.

{"author":"yurigoul","body":"Chances are that people know the difference between their/they're/there but since this is only a forum they just don't give a flying fuck. There are different languages for different situations/jobs. There are jobs where you have to use very precise language, where language is the tool - with the law for instance. The funny thing is that when learning the law it is almost as if you need to learn a new language - and in certain countries you even have to learn a new language because part of the law is written in that other language (Indonesia had Dutch law books for a while). Programming and theology also come to mind.\n\nSo if that is the case, and if we can also assume that certain 'deviant' forms of language are understood by all in our daily lives - why do we care about those mistakes?\n\nI could go on about the natural changes that any language goes through. There are even patterns in it.\n\nEvery language is a code where meaning is generated in the head of the receiver based on the context you are in - and depending on the context there is a different level of fault tolerance. Daily live: high fault tolerance, law: zero fault tolerance, pillow talk: every grunt you make and every laugh can have a different meaning that can only be understood by your lover. \n\nIn the context of this forum you have to realize that  different generations and different social groups are active. These social groups want to be able to recognize each other. Americans always use 'we' and 'our president' - and I can tell you that I am not part of that 'we' and I do not have a president. I read somewhere that in certain circles using a dot at the end of a sentence changes the meaning of the sentence. It is a code and you have to know the code.\n\nCertain other groups might use the mixing of their/they're/there as an equivalent of flipping people like you the bird and as a way to recognize each other. \n\nHave a nice stroll through the linguist subs here on reddit and maybe you could try talk about your problem. My experience is that they are very, very relaxed about such 'mistakes.' In their book, it is probably only very, very interesting.\n\nEDIT: You know what? I have been on reddit for more than 7 years, and if I now get downvoted for a comment like this - even on XKCD - you can all suck my stinking dick. This place has turned into a shithole.

{"author":"Kirsham","body":"If you know what a t-distribution is, skip to the next paragraph. A Student's t-distribution, or simply a t-distribution, is a probability distribution commonly used in statistics. Imagine you have a population with a mean and a standard deviation, which is roughly normally distributed.

Facebook actually got some really [good face verification results using deep nets](https://www.facebook.com/publications/546316888800776/).\n\nThe nice part about CNNs is that they allows us to jointly optimize the feature extractor and classifier. Most computer vision methods from the 90s and early 2000s relied on handcrafted feature extractors like LBP or SIFT, which were suboptimal. Instead of using the pixels as input to the model, these methods turned the image into a vector representation which was supposed to be scale, rotation and illumination invariant, but they weren't really optimized to extract the most discriminative features in the image. With CNN's the inputs are pixels and the convolutional filters which extract the features are learned using training data so they end up doing a better job selecting the features in the image that really help to distinguish what differs between the classes ([You can check out a good example of this at the 4:48 mark in this video](http://vk.com/video-44016343_166868324)). They're a hierarchical model so there are multiple layers of representation learned in the process, going from simple edge detectors all the way up to parts of objects.\n\nI'd say that they already are the de facto standard.

{"author":"therant","body":"I know how bad monopolies are in the USA and that people lack options when it comes to ISPs.\n\nBut fret not, it's basically the same here too.\n\nWe have three country-wide ISPs (as well as TV and landline telephony providers). UPC, RDS and Romtelecom. Romtelecom is the former state-owned telecom company (prior to the fall of communism in 89). UPC and RDS are relatively new arrivals (in the last 10-15 years). UPC and RDS have tried a merger about 5 years ago but they were denied that and laws were put in place to prevent it.\n\nStill, they began splitting up the market and creating influence zones. The providers rarely have areas of distribution that overlap and it's a pain to switch, especially if you're not in a large city.\n\nThat being said, they fight it out in terms of connection speeds and infrastructure. In the past 3 or so years, they have gone from a maximum of 100Mbps connections being sold to 200, 500 and ultimately 1Gbps from RDS, which the others are trying to achieve too ASAP. This competition is ultimately good for the consumer. \n\nI grew up with dial-up. Then switched to broadband and saw speeds increase phenomenally in the past decade. It's amazing how fast the Internet works here, even without maxing out your connection.\n\nAs far as mobile networks go, 4G is not yet implemented country-wide, only in important cities. But mobile network (3G at least) is fast and reliable enough. For example, last summer I was trekking up a semi-remote mountain and could browse the web for directions in the middle of nowhere.\n\nCompanies have to *want* to improve. You guys over there should *make* them want to improve.","word_list":"i know how bad monopolies are in the usa and that people lack options when it comes to isps \n\nbut fret not  it s basically the same here too \n\nwe have three country wide isps  as well as tv and landline telephony providers   upc  rds and romtelecom  romtelecom is the former state owned telecom company  prior to the fall of communism in     upc and rds are relatively new arrivals  in the last     years   upc and rds have tried a merger about   years ago but they were denied that and laws were put in place to prevent it \n\nstill  they began splitting up the market and creating influence zones  the providers rarely have areas of distribution that overlap and it s a pain to switch  especially if you re not in a large city \n\nthat being said  they fight it out in terms of connection speeds and infrastructure  in the past   or so years  they have gone from a maximum of  mbps connections being sold to      and ultimately  gbps from rds  which the others are trying to achieve too asap  this competition is ultimately good for the consumer  \n\ni grew up with dial up  then switched to broadband and saw speeds increase phenomenally in the past decade  it s amazing how fast the internet works here  even without maxing out your connection \n\nas far as mobile networks go   g is not yet implemented country wide  only in important cities  but mobile network   g at least  is fast and reliable enough  for example  last summer i was trekking up a semi remote mountain and could browse the web for directions in the middle of nowhere \n\ncompanies have to  want  to improve  you guys over there should  make  them want to improve "}

{"author":"timothyb89","body":"That number seems a bit high. Usually you'll be looking at `(set size)^(# selections)` to iterate over all of them, which in this case would be 100^4 = 100 million.\n\nThis would be a fairly modest map size. With an average word length of ~5.1 bytes (6.1 including some terminator byte) and an md5sum being 32 hex characters, you'll see an uncompressed, packed size of this map being:\n\n    (100**4 * (6.1 + 32)) / 1024**3 = 3.548 GiB\n\n3.5 GiB is actually really small for a password database - most of the rainbow tables on https://www.freerainbowtables.com/ are as \"little\" as 35 GiB or as much as 1050 GiB. A table like this fit entirely in memory and reverse these sorts of passwords *very* quickly.\n\nOn the other hand, if you use a larger dictionary (say, 2000 words, as in the comic) you'll be looking at:\n\n    (2000**4 * (6.1 + 32)) / 1024**3 = 567734.241 GiB = 554.43 tebibytes\n\nSimilarly, the Ubuntu system dictionary of 99000 words gives:\n\n    (99000**4 * (6.1 + 32)) / 1024**3 = 3408520294446 GiB = 3.1 zebibytes\n\nBrute forcing is a different story. You might be looking at around 500 million hashes per second if brute forcing with a high end GPU and an algorithm like SHA-1. This could mean as little as 0.2 seconds to brute force 4-word password from a dictionary of 100 words, 8.8 hours to brute force a 2000-word dictionary, and 6092 years to crack a password from a 99000-word dictionary.

Without convection gas does not get churned from the outer layers to the inner, so that inner core does not get hydrogen replenished. In those small, cool, red stars however there is a steep temperature gradient and there is convection from the core all the way to the surface so the star gets to burn all the hydrogen it has.

{"author":"mountainunicycler","body":"The interesting thing is the connection between how often certain comics are referenced compared other comics that are referenced a similar number of times. So we have comic 'a', referenced twice, then comic 'b', referenced four times, then 'c', referenced eight times, and then 'd' referenced sixteen times, and this graph shows that each comic is referenced twice as much as the next-most-referenced comic. This is interesting because it shows patterns in what comics are referenced and how they get to be referenced that much. \n\nThis chart shows the interesting result comics are referenced more simply because they are referenced more, because more people are exposed to the comic. By fitting an equation to the graph like this, we can compare other systems that fit the same pattern, like upvotes on reddit.

{"author":"exDM69","body":"I am a racing geek and I enjoy a lot of different motor sport disciplines. I often find myself in a discussion about \"unlimited racing class\" because a lot of people who don't follow racing don't know that in the 1960s and 1970s there were very little restrictions and it was quickly found out that that's a very bad idea.\n\nnote: Some hillclimb competitions still have a virtually unlimited class but the speeds are usually restricted by the fear of death caused by running up a mountainside with a steep cliff you'll fall down if screw up.\n\nBut if there were an \"unlimited racing class\" and I was a race car engineer, the first thing to do would be to get rid of the human driver in the car. That's 60-70 kg (racing drivers are skinny) of useless meatbag in the cockpit. There's probably another 100-200kg or so of safety equipment (helmet, crash structure, roll hoop/cage) as well as excess of chassis surrounding the driver. Computer assisted remote control should easily beat a meatbag at the wheel.\n\nAt this point someone usually suggests that it's a stupid idea, but if you have to put a human in (and bring them back alive), it's no longer \"unrestricted\".\n\nAnother issue would be safety of the audience, because you can build a 400km/h (has been done at LeMans' Mulsanne straight before) car that corners at 10G+, but if you suffer a tyre blowout or something goes wrong, the audience is at peril. If it has to be safe for the audience, it's no longer \"unrestricted\".\n\nFinally there's the question of whether the racing vehicles must touch the ground or not. I'd *love* to see a Wipeout -style scifi racing league but I'm not sure that with current technology we could beat a high-powered, high-downforce car with slick racing tyres if the goal is to run around typical, existing race tracks (especially ones with right hand corners too).\n\n**tl;dr:** unrestricted racing is a stupid idea. If you insist, you can go watch footage of 1970s Can-Am races, or late-70's ground effect F1 cars, 80's turbo-era rallying or F1.

{"author":"Wyboth","body":"A. Car A, because of Newton's second law. Both cars feel the same force, but car B has a lower mass than car A, so its acceleration is greater. Therefore, it will cross the finish line first.\n\nB. Kinetic energy equals 0.5mv^2 . To find the final velocity, use the equation vf^2 = vo^2 + 2ad. Using Newton's second law, since the forces are the same for both, we can determine that car B's acceleration is 1.25 times greater than car A's acceleration (if we assume each car has 1 N of force, then car A's acceleration is 1 m/s^2 and car B's acceleration is 1.25 m/s^2 . Divide car B's acceleration by car A's acceleration, and you get how many times greater it is than car A's acceleration. It doesn't matter what number we picked for the force, since it's a ratio). Since car B's acceleration is 1.25 times greater than car A's acceleration, to make things easy, we'll say car B accelerates at 1.25 m/s^2 , and car A accelerates at 1 m/s^2 (it doesn't matter what numbers we pick, it only matters that B's acceleration is 1.25 times A's acceleration). Now we go back to the Big 4 equation vf^2 = vo^2 + 2ad, where vf is final velocity, vo is original velocity, a is acceleration, and d is distance traveled (1 meter for both, in this case). Since the problem states the cars start from rest, vo will be 0 for both cars. Now, the equation becomes vf^2 = 2 * a * 1. For car A, we substitute in an acceleration of 1 m/s^2, and solve for a final velocity of radical 2 (the square root of 2) m/s. For car B, the final velocity is radical 2.5. Now, finally, we can go back to the kinetic energy equation KE = 0.5mv^2. For car A, it's KE = 0.5 * 1 * sqrt(2)^2 = 1 J. For car B, KE = 0.5 * 0.8 * sqrt(2.5)^2 = 1 J. They are the same, so the third choice is correct.\n\nC. Momentum is mass times velocity. We were given both masses, and we solved for a final velocity based on our assumed acceleration (again, the actual numbers don't matter, what matters is that they follow the ratio), so this is easy. Car A's momentum is 1 * sqrt(2) = 1.414. Car B's momentum is 0.8 * sqrt(2.5) = 1.265. Car A has the greater momentum.\n\nIf you're confused about anything, let me know.","word_list":"a  car a  because of newton s second law  both cars feel the same force  but car b has a lower mass than car a  so its acceleration is greater  therefore  it will cross the finish line first \n\nb  kinetic energy equals    mv     to find the final velocity  use the equation vf     vo      ad  using newton s second law  since the forces are the same for both  we can determine that car b s acceleration is     times greater than car a s acceleration  if we assume each car has   n of force  then car a s acceleration is   m s   and car b s acceleration is     m s     divide car b s acceleration by car a s acceleration  and you get how many times greater it is than car a s acceleration  it doesn t matter what number we picked for the force  since it s a ratio   since car b s acceleration is     times greater than car a s acceleration  to make things easy  we ll say car b accelerates at     m s     and car a accelerates at   m s    it doesn t matter what numbers we pick  it only matters that b s acceleration is     times a s acceleration   now we go back to the big   equation vf     vo      ad  where vf is final velocity  vo is original velocity  a is acceleration  and d is distance traveled    meter for both  in this case   since the problem states the cars start from rest  vo will be   for both cars  now  the equation becomes vf         a      for car a  we substitute in an acceleration of   m s    and solve for a final velocity of radical    the square root of    m s  for car b  the final velocity is radical      now  finally  we can go back to the kinetic energy equation ke      mv    for car a  it s ke             sqrt          j  for car b  ke               sqrt            j  they are the same  so the third choice is correct \n\nc  momentum is mass times velocity  we were given both masses  and we solved for a final velocity based on our assumed acceleration  again  the actual numbers don t matter  what matters is that they follow the ratio   so this is easy  car a s momentum is     sqrt           car b s momentum is       sqrt             car a has the greater momentum \n\nif you re confused about anything  let me know "}

{"author":"Abstruse","body":"I'd like to see the unedited version because what they had did not paint Randall very well. Several of his responses are his standard Q&amp;A answers he gives really well at his talks on YouTube (the oldest from over five years ago that I recall), yet Colbert seemed like he stepped all over them. He'd ask questions and Randall would give an obvious set-up for a joke, and Colbert would then cut him off before the punchline.\n\nExample of what I mean. He talks about the ball pitched at 0.9c and he starts talking about the fusion going on and shockwave and science science science...but before he can say, \"And according to the rulebook, the batter would be considered hit by pitch\" Colbert cuts him off (or the editor did). It stomped all over the joke.\n\nThe result was that Randall came off as nervous, quiet, introverted, unfunny, and serious. If I hadn't seen his Q&amp;As, I would probably walk away having seen that thinking that's what he's like. I think if he'd had more breathing room or even if they'd cut a few of the questions to let Randall fully answer them, it would've played much better.\n\nAgain, I don't blame Randall at all. He seemed a little nervous but no more than I've seen other authors in interviews. I also don't blame Colbert per se because he had points he needed to hit in a specific time limit. I just think it was a case of two types of comedy not meshing together well at all.","word_list":"i d like to see the unedited version because what they had did not paint randall very well  several of his responses are his standard q amp a answers he gives really well at his talks on youtube  the oldest from over five years ago that i recall   yet colbert seemed like he stepped all over them  he d ask questions and randall would give an obvious set up for a joke  and colbert would then cut him off before the punchline \n\nexample of what i mean  he talks about the ball pitched at    c and he starts talking about the fusion going on and shockwave and science science   before he can say   and according to the rulebook  the batter would be considered hit by pitch  colbert cuts him off  or the editor did   it stomped all over the joke \n\nthe result was that randall came off as nervous  quiet  introverted  unfunny  and serious  if i hadn t seen his q amp as  i would probably walk away having seen that thinking that s what he s like  i think if he d had more breathing room or even if they d cut a few of the questions to let randall fully answer them  it would ve played much better \n\nagain  i don t blame randall at all  he seemed a little nervous but no more than i ve seen other authors in interviews  i also don t blame colbert per se because he had points he needed to hit in a specific time limit  i just think it was a case of two types of comedy not meshing together well at all "}
