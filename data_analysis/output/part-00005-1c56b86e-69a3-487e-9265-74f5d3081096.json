They were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly among amateur websites.\n\n&gt;To be a part of the webring, each site has a common [navigation bar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_bar); it contains links to the previous and next site. By selecting next (or previous) repeatedly, the user will eventually reach the site they started at; this is the origin of the term webring. However, the select-through route around the ring is usually supplemented by a central site with links to all member sites; this prevents the ring from breaking completely if a member site goes offline. A web ring is managed from one website which is able to omit the websites that have dropped out or are no longer reachable. The advantage of a web ring is that if the user is interested in the topic on one website, they can quickly connect to another website on the same topic.  Webrings usually have a moderator who decides which pages to include in the web ring. After approval, webmasters add their pages to the ring by 'linking in' to the ring; this requires adding the necessary [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) or [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) to their site.\n\n&gt;Sites usually join a webring in order to receive traffic from related sites. When used to improve search engine rankings, webrings can be considered a [search engine optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) technique.\n\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^LinkExchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkExchange) ^| [^GURPS ^Traveller: ^Interstellar ^Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS_Traveller:_Interstellar_Wars) ^| [^Interwiki ^links](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interwiki_links) ^| [^Syracuse ^Junction ^Railroad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_Junction_Railroad) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cfn6clx) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cfn6clx)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/) ^| [^flag ^a ^glitch](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/autowikibot&amp;subject=Glitched comment report&amp;message=What seems wrong: (optional description goes here\\)%0A%0A---%0A%0AReply no. 68665:%0Ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/xkcd/comments/1yrowd/second/cfn6ci4)","score":7,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

The ones that most like it were pollonated more often than the ones that looked less like it, and the ones that didn't even look close likely followed some other evolutionary pressure from other species of bees.  \n\nOver time, plants that looked more like it flourished and the complementary bee flourished.  At some point, some evolutionary pressure decreased the population of complementary bee.  At that point, looking like that bee wasn't evolutionarily beneficial.  Now what can the plant do?  The species would die off without pollination from the now-rare bee.  Fortunately, however, some of the plants had the ability to self-pollinate.  Next what happened was the ones without the ability to self-pollinate died off, while the ones with the ability flourished.\n\nEdit:  Note that this self-pollination which ended up being beneficial in this case was not the \"fittest\".  In fact, self-pollination restricts the amount of genetic variation in later generations of plants.  If some sort of evolutionary pressure comes along that the plant can't cope with, there will be less chance that some of the population CAN cope with it.  Without a part of the population that CAN cope, the species is doomed.","score":6,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

The flowers that were the most bee-like were more successful.\n\n&gt; If bees don't land on it now then how could the flower's ancestor that didn't really look like a bee ever begin to attract bees in the first place?\n\nIt's ancestor *did* attract bees. The ones that looked bee-like attracted *more* bees are were more successful in reproduction. The plant itself does not know what bees look like, nor is it even aware of bees.\n\n&gt; If it only needs to sorta resemble a bee to attract them then why would the species of the bee matter, and why don't bees land on it now?\n\nBecause bees can recognize their own species. Only one species of bee was attracted to the look of the flower. Now that the specific bee species is extinct, there are no other bees that recognize that look as a mate.\n\n&gt; Are we sure we're not just anthropomorphizing it?\n\nWe *are* anthropomorphizing it. From a logical human perspective, it appears to us as if the plant can somehow see bees and choose to morph to adapt. This is not how it actually works though. The appearance of the flower is only related to the success of its ancestors, and the ones that made the most plant babies were the ones that looked the most like bees. Nature is amazing, because even though our initial perception is wrong, the true story behind how it got that way is a multi-million year long journey of genetic success.","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

The plant itself can simply be unappealing to bees too. Think about it, it's most successful strategy was tricking bees into landing on it. The bees didn't care for its nectar or pollen. So it's not that bees are avoiding it because they believe another bee is on it, they avoid it because it's a worthless plant to them.\n\nIt's kind of a sad story now that the one bee species that got tricked into landing on it is now extinct. It's left to self-pollinating, unattractive to other bees. Self-pollinating is just a way of barely hanging on though. Too many copies of the same genes and you all die to the same disease.

{"author":"rspeer","created_date":"2014-10-10 21:59:14","body":"I'm starting to do some frequency analysis, and it's promising.\n\nThe file uses a limited number of different byte values -- only 69 out of the 256 possible bytes.\n\n(Combined with the fact that a lot of the byte values it's using are in the range that UTF-8 uses, it's not surprising that it looks like a bunch of similar UTF-8 characters. And it's not that surprising that those characters would be Chinese. Throw a dart at Unicode and you'll probably hit Chinese.)\n\nHere's a plot where the x axis is the byte value, and the y axis is the number of times that byte occurs:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2wCciF3.png\n\nIf you sort them in rank order, the frequencies fall off exponentially for a while. Here's that plot with frequency on a log scale:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/O5pDt3T.png\n\nThe fact that the bytes have some kind of exponentially decreasing distribution to them implies that they're probably not just random noise, and not encrypted in any cryptographically strong way. There's some sort of signal or message to be found.\n\nIf it's text, it's not in any commonly-used encoding. It has a lot of byte 31 (0x1f) which is just into the useless-control-character range in almost all encodings. (EDIT: Not 25. Why did I think this was byte 25?) I am trying the uncommon ones now.\n\nIt could also be an image of some kind, with a curiously restricted palette. The number of bytes is 257 x 2240, among other factorings, if you want to try to make it into a rectangle.\n\n----\n\nI think I'm going to give up on the image approach for a while. If there was an image to be found, I should be able to reshape it somehow to get at least something that looks like a distorted, scrambled image. As opposed to this.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WxgGt3j.png\n\n----\n\n**Found something!**\n\nThis might explain why it looks like UTF-8. If you *add 1* to every byte, then decode as UTF-8, then it decodes completely. You still get mostly Chinese gibberish, with occasional characters from elsewhere in Unicode. But every 2-4 characters it has ASCII characters 0x20 through 0x23. Mostly 0x21, which is the exclamation mark.\n\nIt doesn't *mean* anything yet, but it may be another layer to decode. (And it may mean that I did something not quite right, and if you do something slightly different from what I did you get a better clue.)\n\nAfter shifting by one byte, the beginning of it looks like this:\n\n    硔椺 幅幊!幅䀈 滖燮!彍蠓!溝湃!邆뜷!뜸!曜䁈\"ꜷ!鵰邇夺!椻\"뜷\"궱彎徎\"鵱弎低!廍底弖\"走彍弎!Ꜷ!\n\nHere's the beginning of the characters one by one, with their Unicode codepoints, categories, and names:\n\n    U+7854  硔       [Lo] CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-7854\n    U+693A  椺       [Lo] CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-693A\n    U+0020           [Zs] SPACE\n    U+5E45  幅       [Lo] CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-5E45\n    U+5E4A  幊       [Lo] CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-5E4A\n    U+0021  !

Starting with [Windows 98](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98), Microsoft included a \"[Windows Update](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Update)\" system that would check for [patches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing\\)) to [Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) and its components, which Microsoft would release intermittently. With the release of [Microsoft Update](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Update), this system also checks for updates to other [Microsoft products](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_software_applications), such as [Office](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office), [Visual Studio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio) and [SQL Server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server).\n\n&gt;Patch Tuesday begins at 18:00 or 17:00 [GMT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time) (10:00 [PST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Standard_Time) (GMT-8) or 10:00 [PDT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Daylight_Time) (GMT-7)). Sometimes there is an extraordinary Patch Tuesday, 14 days after the regular Patch Tuesday.

Just now I looked at CNN, and they had the question \"Do you care less about midterm elections?\" Ignoring the fact that they don't have anything to compare it to (am I comparing it to how much I care about interracial marriage?), how am I suppose to not care less about the mid-term elections? I care about the presidential race and the results, and I care about the mid-term election. Since the mid-term elections are a subset of the quadrennial elections, then the logical answers to \"Do you care less about the mid-term elections?\" should be \"yes\" and \"I don't care who is president\". When viewed that way it becomes obvious that the survey results are mostly surveying how the question is interpreted, not what you want to know (do you care less about congressional/local elections than you care about presidential elections).\n\nA well created survey will figure out the answer you want without ever having to ask the question directly, but it creates no shocker yes/no poll results, and the right answers will never make it into headlines because it tells you about the 60% approval rating, instead the news reports will focus on the fact that only 10% of the population said they strongly approve of it.","score":4,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Heartbleed allows a malicious actor to read up to 64KiB of memory from a random spot from the process using the vulnerable openssl library (the web/email/database server).  So its not limited to server's memory as implied, just the webserver's memory (modern operating systems make each process live in a separate address space, so it is impossible for a webserver to say read the memory of another process).  The worst part of it, is that with many attempts its generally possible to get the server's private key (without being logged as you can do this at the start of a TLS handshake), and hence anyone can eavesdrop or alter TLS traffic to the server.  \n\nSo basically any affected servers need to revoke their keys and issue new ones, at which point all clients should change their passwords (which may have also leaked).\n\nSee http://security.stackexchange.com/q/55270/2568 for more discussion of this comic security wise.","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Yudkowsky isn't particularly good at explaining this to people who don't think much like him, but [Nate Soares](http://mindingourway.com/newcomblike-problems-are-the-norm/) is; that's a blog post about how Newcomb-like problems (the situations where you get screwed unless you accept acausal trades in at least some circumstances) are actually critical for everyday social interactions; we acausally know things about how people work in general, and every time you interact with strangers, you're unconsciously leaning on something like acausal trade.","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}
{"author":"VorpalAuroch","created_date":"2014-11-23 02:46:13","body":"&gt;Apparently the basis is that you can make mutually beneficial agreements with people who don't exist yet.\n\nYeah, this is a really confusing idea when poorly stated (which is usually, Yudkowsky included). For a detailed discussion, look [here](http://mindingourway.com/newcomblike-problems-are-the-norm/) and the couple posts before it on Nate Soares's blog. But the summary is this:\n\nIn everyday life, whenever you interact with strangers you have partial knowledge of how they decide things, both based on knowing that they are humans are humans mostly work certain ways and by reading microexpressions, body language, etc., which people largely can't control consciously. Because this is true, we overwhelmingly make decisions as if the other person involved understands how we think to some degree, even when they have no ability to punish us if their understanding is wrong. \n\nGeneralizing and formalizing that strategy implies that you should act as though you were being simulated by someone who will give the 'real you' benefits if the simulation of you does what they want. ([Newcomb's Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox) is a thought experiment that tries to boil this down to something very explicit and simple.) Once you have that (and you need it to avoid being screwed, which is why all non-sociopaths have a mild version of it natively), it's a natural consequence that the simulation of you can happen at any time in the past or future. An example: Ancient Sufficiently Advanced Aliens have the option of preventing a supernova that would have killed us in -50 BCE, but think we might end up being rivals to them when we become Sufficiently Advanced ourselves and make contact with them. They simulate our future development, and they save us if and only if we seem like good future neighbors. Less compelling, less science-fictiony example: I talk with you about this kind of idea, and then later, by coincidence, we both show up on [Friend or Foe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend_or_Foe%3F_%28TV_series%29), the Prisoner's Dilemma game show. Knowing that our decisions cannot affect the other, but that we would both benefit from cooperating, we can each acausally trade with the other guy 30 seconds into the future and we can both walk away with several thousand dollars.\n\nIt gets more important if you also buy into the formulation of personal identity that argues that you after you wake up tomorrow morning is no different from a simulation of tomorrow morning from your perspective, run a thousand years in the future. It's hard to avoid something like this without buying into something else that  looks suspiciously like 'Souls exist'; LW's mainline strand of thought is that this notion of identity (called the 'pattern theory') is the only version compatible with quantum-aware strong materialism, which is a stronger conclusion than most philosophers take, but not unknown.","score":3,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Yes, the new rule was put in place *after* /r/jailbait was removed, but if it wasn't for this rule being put in place /r/jailbait may have very well been allowed back and they simply removed it while they were discussing what to do. They put the rule in place specifically because they didn't want /r/jailbait to have been removed for some arbitrary reason and not have it apply to everywhere equally. You are right, various mods agree or disagree with whether or not /r/jailbait used to be within the rules, but it's absolutely clear now that it's not even if it used to be.\n\n&gt; And how about the instances where mods and/or admins use those apparently inviolable rules to enforce their own policies? No matter how airtight you make them there will always be some asshole or another there to exploit every hole they can find. That is why simply pointing to the rules and saying \"follow those\" does not work. That is why relying on rules to sort things out does not work.\n\nThen you can complain that they're not following the rules, that's the *entire idea*. And yes, rules aren't perfect and will have to be updated from time to time. Shocking.\n\nAs for /r/holocaust, I said I didn't like the *content*, not that I didn't like it being allowed.\n\n&gt; WHAT RECOURSE DO THE USERS HAVE?\n\nYou create a different subreddit and use that one? Have you forgotten about /r/xkcdcomic? That's a perfectly valid response to such a problem, and people have been doing it for a long time. If you don't like a subreddit just go *create your own*.\n\nAnd I also agree with you, in many was being featured on the news pushed them to do something about it when they weren't going to do before. That said, child-pornography is fairly universally illegal, I'm not to shocked that they decided to put in rules about child-pornography even though they don't have rules about lots of other illegal things. IMO, if they were going to pick anything to completely ban on Reddit, child-pornography was probably the easiest to agree on. I agree with you, it is a bit of a double-standard, but Reddit *still* put in specific rules about it. They're not just going around randomly removing content without thinking about it because they don't agree with it, they talked it over for a while and put in very specific rules about it.","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

You can barely see the drivers when the race is on. Albeit the psychology factor does make it sometimes a bit more interesting but top-level racing drivers rarely succumb to pressure. Of course, the drivers are idolized and that brings a human element to an otherwise mechanical sport and I can understand the appeal in that.\n\nOne aspect that makes humans racers more interesting to watch is that they make more mistakes.\n\nBut why would AI races be interesting? Because the meatbag in the cockpit is dead weight that doesn't add any horsepower, and worse, they must make it out alive most of the time and that restricts how fast you can go.\n\nIf Colin Chapman (the genius behind Lotus F1 cars in 60s-80s) was still around, I'm sure he'd take the driver out as soon as it was feasible. \"Simplify, then add lightness\".\n\nIf we had AI races, we could make the cars go 400-500 km/h (assuming they'd be powered by conventional engines and use tyres, maybe even more if not) and corner at G forces that would make a human driver black out. That would be *spectacular*.\n\nHigher speeds and cornering forces means that aero drag and downforce play a bigger role, which would hopefully promote overtaking by drafting as well as force the cars to drive different lines through corners to avoid downforce loss due to turbulent air.\n\nIt would be different for sure, but would it be boring? I don't think so but I understand that someone might disagree with me.\n\nBut because state of the art in racing AIs is so poor, if you'd take the human out of the cockpit, the first step would be having humans at the wheel but controlled remotely.","score":7,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

You say that's something that bothers you. And you're right that it may very well bother other people. But people who get bothered by casual tones in online comments are not people whose opinions I particularly care about. Now, taking your analogy, if I were writing professionally (which is indeed something I plan to do someday), then I'd feel differently. In professional writing, it absolutely is a problem to start three out of four consecutive paragraphs with the same conjunction. And in professional writing, you do have to take such complaints seriously to avoid losing popularity and never knowing why, as you say.\n\nBut I know all that. You're assuming this is how I always write. You're assuming that I didn't make a conscious decision to write in the way I did, and that I can't make a conscious decision to write other ways. These assumptions are incorrect. I would never use \"so\" in that way in something I were writing professionally, unless I were going for a deliberately casual feel. In fact, I just checked the short story I've been working on the past week, currently 2,800 words long, and I have not started a single sentence with the word \"so.\"\n\n\"So\" in this context is a word you use to tell a story. It's even how the great Seamus Heaney chose to translate the first word of English's oldest written story, *Beowulf*.

{"author":"tsahyt","created_date":"2014-09-23 10:24:31","body":"Just two obvious reasons why this isn't representative.\n\nFirst of all, your wordlist is really really small. When bruteforcing against a list of passwords using a dictionary you want the dictionary to be as big as possible, so the probability of actually finding a match is higher. Your wordlist is about 2700 words long. Wordlists that are commonly used are somewhere from 100000 to multiple *million* lines long. If your script exhausted all possible 4-word combinations, that'd make about 5e13 combinations, while with a small-ish common wordlist of 100000 words you're already at 1e20. That's a *big* difference. Coincidentally, your wordlist is also built such that \"correcthorsebatterystaple\" is the very first 4-word match that actually gets built.\n\nSecond, you're comparing plaintext strings. An attacker who has access to plaintext passwords doesn't need to bruteforce them. Intentionally slow and expensive hash algorithms like scrypt or bcrypt are used for a reason. The asymptotic runtime of any sort of brute force cracking is a given, so in order to ensure additional security beyond sheer password size, you want the constant to be as large as possible to make the cracking even more expensive. As an educated guess, you'd probably have to account for a factor of at least 1000 or so here.","score":10,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

This pulsar was discovered by [Jason W. T. Hessels](/w/index.php?title=Jason_W._T._Hessels&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1) of [McGill University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_University) on November 10, 2004 and confirmed on January 8, 2005.\n\n&gt;It has been calculated that the neutron star contains slightly less than two times the mass of the Sun, which is approximately the same for all [neutron stars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star). Its radius is constrained to be less than 16 km. At its equator it is spinning at approximately 24% of the speed of light, or over 70,000 km per second.\n\n&gt;The pulsar is located in a [globular cluster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster) of stars called [Terzan 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terzan_5), located approximately 18,000 [light-years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year) from [Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) in the [constellation Sagittarius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation\\)). It is part of a [binary system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star) and undergoes regular [eclipses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse) with an [eclipse fraction](/w/index.php?title=Eclipse_fraction&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1) of about 40%. Its orbit is highly circular with a 26 hour period. The other object is about 0.14 solar masses, with a radius of 5–6 solar radii. Hessels states that the companion may be a \"bloated [main-sequence star](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main-sequence_star), possibly still filling its [Roche Lobe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_lobe)\".\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Pulsar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar) ^| [^PSR ^B1937+21](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1937%2B21) ^| [^Arecibo ^Observatory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Observatory) ^| [^Victoria ^Kaspi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Kaspi) \n\n*^\\/u/NyteMyre ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cfhfaoq) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cfhfaoq)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less.* ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/) ^| [^flag ^a ^glitch](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/autowikibot&amp;subject=Glitched comment report&amp;message=What seems wrong: (optional description goes here\\)%0A%0A---%0A%0AReply no. 60095:%0Ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/xkcd/comments/1y4nc1/xkcd_1331_frequency/cfhfamn)","score":12,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

He suffered more than 433 bone fractures  in his career, thereby earning an entry in the *[Guinness Book of World Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_Book_of_World_Records)* as the survivor of \"most bones broken in a lifetime\".
