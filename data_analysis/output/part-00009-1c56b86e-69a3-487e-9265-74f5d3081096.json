The truth of the matter is much less clean (epigenetics comes to mind as an immediate example of how information can be transferred from a protein to nucleic acid). It also depends on what exactly you mean by a gene. Traditionally, the term gene refers to a region of DNA (or RNA depending on your system). In this case, DNA does not, on its own, control which proteins are made; proteins themselves can turn genes \"on\" or \"off\", sometimes permanently (this is what happens to stem cells when they become somatic cells). Granted, the proteins that affect this are encoded by genes, but there is still that complexity in the relationship that the central dogma overlooks.\n\nSo yes, as a general approximation, living things' traits are determined by their genes, but saying that runs the risk of oversimplifying what is, in reality, anything but a one-way road.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology#Transfers_of_information_not_explicitly_covered_in_the_theory","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Earth launch cost prohibitive, ecologically disastrous and insane.  \n\nSo aside from a one-way trip with tiny crew at an enormous cost no one wants to pay (especially for the negligible return such a tiny crew could give) - don't expect anything until there are orbital construction facilities.\n\n^1 Unless we figure out hibernation/suspended animation - that could cut down on space and consumable needed until wake up - then you would still need all of it - just fewer consumables.","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

The most distant *bright* star (i.e. with an apparent magnitude lower than 1.5) is Deneb, which is thought to be about 2,600 ly away, but there are more distant stars that can be seen at least sometimes with the naked eye, like Eta Carinae (7,500-8,000 ly).  It's [highly variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_blue_variable), and it sometimes goes through quiescent phases where it drops below the threshold for naked eye visibility (i.e. an apparent magnitude of about 6.5), but it's been visible for the last few years now.  In fact, it was the second brightest star in the night sky for a while, when it underwent a supernova impostor event in the 1840s.\n\nAs for Andromeda, it's actually a bit larger than a point source (it looks like someone took a moderately bright star and smudged it), although it may look that way if you're looking at it under less-than-ideal conditions.  You can't see its spiral arms with the naked eye though, only the nucleus.\n\nEDIT: Accidentally said that Deneb was the nearest bright star, not the furthest.  Obviously not the case, since Alpha Centauri is obviously the closest bright star (and third brightest nighttime star overall, after Canopus and Sirius).","score":8,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Well, antimatter is where you have negative protons (called antiprotons, but I think they missed out on calling them negatrons) and positive electrons (called positrons).  The problem with antimatter is that if it collides with normal matter, it releases a ton of gamma rays and neutrinos.  This turns into a ton of energy.  So the problem with antimatter (and why it's so rare) is that it's really hard to collect and contain, since all containers are made of matter.  It's like trying to collect lava with a paper cup, you'll just end up with with an extremely dangerous mess.  At best, we can capture charged antiparticles with a combined magnetic and electric field, but the longest we could preserve an atom of antihydrogen was 17 minutes.\n\nAntimatter's got an extremely high energy density, so if you could collect and contain enough it would be a great option for rocket fuel.  The problem is that it's extremely hard to make antimatter right now, with estimates of $250 million per 10 mg.  \n\nSource: Wikipedia to confirm facts","score":5,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

There's only one known copy of it, and in 2010 it sold for $2,300,000. That works out to about $30 billion per kilogram of stamps. If the Earth's weight were entirely postage stamps, it would still not be enough to pay off Au Bon Pain's potential debt.\n\nHe's not thinking about this properly. To solve this, I suggest we try to employ RIAA-maths. 1 song is worth $1.5 x 10^6 dollar. Let's use a 3 minute song as the norm. That's a 3 MB MP3 file. [SanDisk's 128 GB Micro SD card weighs just under 6 gram](http://www.sandisk.com/goto/newmicrosd128/), and it can store 42,600 3 MB MP3 files. That works out to 2.13 x 10^5 songs/gram for a total of 3.195 x 10^11 dollars/gram. That's a lot closer than the paltry 30 million/kg worth of stamps.\n\nIn fact, we only need 6.26 x 10^25 gram worth of MicroSD cards to achieve that. So, what has a mass of roughly 6 x 10^25 gram or 6 x 10^22 kg? Well, Earth is much to large. That's 6 ×10^24 kg. We need something that has a mass roughly 1% of Earth's.\n\nFortunately, [Wikipedia has a very useful list of Solar System objects](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Solar_System_objects_by_size). Europa (4.8 x 10^22 kg) is too small, but the Moon is plenty large, coming in at 7.35 x 10^22 kg.\n\nNow, as it happens, I happen to know that the middle section of the Moon (its core and so on) happens to be a giant memory storage unit, left behind by an ancient alien civilization.

(travel time ∝ number of floors; limit of floor accessibility as travel time -&gt; ∞ = 0)\n\nA solution for this is to have \"express\" elevators that move at high speed and don't stop at lower floors. However, elevators take up a lot of space. The elevator takes up floor space in *every single floor* it accesses. So as you add more blocks of that require new express elevators, you increase your elevator requirement at the lower floors, thus reducing lower-floor space less. You can get to the point where the floor space eaten up by a new elevator would be more than the floor space it accesses. So that you'd actually be destroying floor-space as you add more floors.\n\nNet building floor space added per floor block = floor space for each new floor -(floor space of new elevator * number of floors)\n\nAll those elevator shafts eat up major floor space and the amount of floor space they eat up increases as the building increases in height. You could partially offset this by having multiple stops, but then you're back to your time/speed problem.\n\nTL;DR elevators are like vertical roads in a building; the taller the building, the higher the traffic and the more lanes you need, the more roads you need, eating up space that would otherwise be usable. Eventually the roads get so long that new floors require more space in new roads than they create by being floors: also, the bottom floors are pretty much all roads\n\n","score":4,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

They don't need to put themself out there. Males will approach them and all they need to do is accept or reject the offer. The worst thing that can happen In  terms of their self-esteem is that nobody makes an offer. I guess that sucks but such implicit rejection doen't happen in front of someone they've just made themselves vulnerable to.\n\nA male introvert however has two choices. 1) be alone forever, or 2) put themself out there and approach a female. This is a huge deal for a shy person. It takes every bit of will power they have. Rejection is the most likely outcome of this too. Far more likely for a shy male than an outgoing one. They will be nervous and that will be seen as weakness, a trait almost universally seen as repulsive in men.\n\nSo they make themselves vulnerable and get rejected. Unlike the case for the female, this is an explicit rejection and happens while they are facing the person they just made themself vulnerable to.\n\nThis is not the fault of the women. They have the right to make their own choices who they will accept and who they will reject but I understand how shy men become bitter and might look for stupid techniques to manipulate women into accepting them.","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Twenty-five states,  the [District of Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_District_of_Columbia), and ten [Native American tribal jurisdictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_under_United_States_tribal_jurisdictions)  issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Several hundreds to thousands of marriage licenses were issued to same-sex couples in [Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Michigan) and [Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Arkansas) between the time their bans were struck down by federal or state courts and when those rulings were [stayed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay_of_proceedings#United_States).\n\n&gt;The movement to obtain [civil marriage rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_and_responsibilities_of_marriages_in_the_United_States) and benefits for same-sex couples in the United States began in the 1970s,  but became increasingly prominent in U.S. politics following the 1993 [Hawaii Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_Supreme_Court) decision in *[Baehr v. Lewin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baehr_v._Miike)* that declared that state's prohibition to be unconstitutional.  On May 17, 2004, [Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Massachusetts) became the first U.S. state and the sixth jurisdiction in the world to legalize same-sex marriage following the [Supreme Judicial Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Supreme_Judicial_Court)'s decision in *[Goodridge v. Department of Public Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodridge_v._Department_of_Public_Health)* six months earlier.  During the 21st century, public support for same-sex marriage has grown considerably,   and national polls conducted since 2011 show that a majority of Americans support legalizing it. On May 9, 2012, [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) became the first sitting [U.S. president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) to publicly declare support for the legalization of same-sex marriage.  On November 6, 2012, [Maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Question_1,_2012), [Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Question_6), and [Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Referendum_74) became the first states to legalize same-sex marriage through popular vote.\n\n&gt;Some same-sex couples have, with varying degrees of success, sought court-ordered recognition of their marriages based on their specific circumstances. The Seventh Circuit and a U.S. district court have each required Indiana to recognize a marriage where one plaintiff is terminally ill.   A U.S. district court in Arizona has required the state to recognize one same-sex marriage for the purpose of issuing a death certificate.  and a U.S. district court in Ohio issued a similar order with respect to four birth certificates.  A Florida state court has recognized an out-of state same-sex marriage to allow a widower to serve as executor of his spouse's estate.  Similar plaintiffs have appealed adverse decisions or had rulings in their favor stayed pending appeal in several states.  Some states recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions for a specific purpose: Alaska for survivor's benefits  and property tax exemptions,  Colorado for filing state income taxes,  Ohio for death certificates,  and Wyoming for obtaining a divorce. \n\n&gt;Since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the law barring federal recognition of same-sex marriage in *[United States v. Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Windsor)* on June 26, 2013, U.S. district courts in thirteen states  and state courts in five states  have found that same-sex marriage bans violate the [U.S. Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States), while one U.S. district court  and one state court  have found that they do not. The [U.S. Courts of Appeals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Courts_of_Appeals) for the [Fourth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_Fourth_Circuit), [Seventh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_Seventh_Circuit), [Ninth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_Circuit_Court_of_Appeals), and [Tenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_Tenth_Circuit) Circuits have affirmed the unconstitutionality of such bans. Additionally, a U.S. district court in Ohio  and a state court in Missouri  have ordered those states to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions. All these rulings have been stayed except the ones denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court on October 6, 2014, the Ninth Circuit's rulings on October 7,  the Missouri state court ruling recognizing out-of-state marriages, and two U.S. district court rulings in Oregon and Pennsylvania, where the state defendants did not appeal the district courts' rulings and their orders ended those states' bans on same-sex marriage. \n\n&gt;On October 6, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear appeals in all the cases it had been asked to consider from appellate courts in the [Fourth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_Fourth_Circuit), [Seventh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_Seventh_Circuit), and [Tenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_Tenth_Circuit) Circuits, allowing decisions from those courts striking down marriage bans to stand. The states with bans at issue in those cases were Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The court's action has led to legal same-sex marriage in Colorado; it is also expected to affect other states within the three circuits, including Wyoming, Kansas, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, as well as states where U.S. district courts have already held the state's denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples unconstitutional.  A decision the next day by the Ninth Circuit invalidating bans on same-sex marriage in Idaho and Nevada is expected to also affect Alaska, Arizona, and Montana. \n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/aw7sLef.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Same-sex_marriage_in_San_Francisco_City_Hall_20080617.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Public ^opinion ^of ^same-sex ^marriage ^in ^the ^United ^States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion_of_same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States) ^| [^List ^of ^supporters ^of ^same-sex ^marriage ^in ^the ^United ^States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supporters_of_same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States) ^| [^List ^of ^opponents ^of ^same-sex ^marriage ^in ^the ^United ^States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_opponents_of_same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States) ^| [^Same-sex ^marriage ^law ^in ^the ^United ^States ^by ^state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_law_in_the_United_States_by_state) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cl48ygn) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cl48ygn)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

It is an [odd-toed ungulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd-toed_ungulate) [mammal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal) belonging to the taxonomic family [Equidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equidae). The horse has [evolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_horse) over the past 45 to 55 million years from a [small multi-toed creature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyracotherium) into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to [domesticate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication) horses around 4000 BC, and their [domestication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_the_horse) is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies *caballus* are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as [feral horses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_horses). These feral populations are not true [wild horses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_horse), as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered [Przewalski's horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przewalski%27s_horse), a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true [wild horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_horse). There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from [anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy) to life stages, size, [colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equine_coat_color), [markings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_markings), [breeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_breed), [locomotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_locomotion), and behavior.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/znrv04K.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nokota_Horses_cropped.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^HORSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HORSE) ^| [^Horse ^racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing) ^| [^Horse ^breeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_breeding) ^| [^Equestrianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cke8ih1) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cke8ih1)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

It is conceived as an abstract machine that can be in one of a finite number of states. The machine is in only one state at a time; the state it is in at any given time is called the current state. It can change from one state to another when initiated by a triggering event or condition, this is called a transition.

While they will happily explore the reason for their feelings, they will refuse to challenge them in any way because that would mean loosing something and the fact that you considered their feelings makes them think they can probably get away with their behaviour. They do know that they are contributing to a problem but they do not care because they are suffering too. So, empathy is quite useless as a tactic at that point because it's a one way street. \n\nMy \"favorite\" was when one guy tried to defend sexual assault because he personally wouldn't mind when it happend to him more often. I had known him personally for some time at that point and I knew that this was 100% consistent with his view. I also knew why he was bitter against women. Still, trying to even get him to even consider the feelings of the party he offended that way (to say nothing of the party he pretty much killed with that stunt) was next to impossible.

For comparison, let's go with the max dictionary size of the OED, ~616,500 words including variants, thus a little over 19 bits, so rounding up to 20, still more than Randall's 16. add another 4 bits for substitutions, 1 for capitalization, lets go with 10 bits altogether for the random two-character string of either punctuation or numbers at the end OR beginning of the password (more than Randall's estimate, again), and you still only have 35 bits of entropy.","score":4,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

The Prime Directive, used in four out of five *Star Trek*-based series, prohibits Starfleet personnel from interfering with the internal development of alien civilizations. This conceptual law applies particularly to civilizations which are below a certain threshold of technological, scientific and cultural development; preventing starship crews from using their superior technology to impose their own values or ideals on them. Since its introduction in the first season of the [original *Star Trek* series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series), it has served as the focus of numerous episodes of the various series. As time-travel became a recurring feature in the franchise, the concept was expanded as a Temporal Prime Directive, prohibiting those under its orders from interfering in historical events.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Prime ^Directive ^\\(role-playing ^game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Directive_\\(role-playing_game\\)) ^| [^RoboCop: ^Prime ^Directives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop:_Prime_Directives) ^| [^Prime ^Directive ^Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Directive_Records) ^| [^Prime ^Directive ^\\(album)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Directive_\\(album\\)) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cljagzm) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cljagzm)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

{"author":"altrocks","created_date":"2014-08-29 13:25:35","body":"I dunno, how would you do if we dropped you in the middle of a foreign country where no one knows English? It's a completely different language you're talking about. We have a formal and standardized system of communication to use. If you want to be understood correctly, you need to encode your ideas correctly.\n\nHowever, to answer your question, yes, you need to comprehend nearly every word in a sentence to understand its meaning. One word can completely change the meaning of a sentence. When people write their/there/they're interchangeably, and it's not just an autocorrect oversight, what the reader sees is that the writer  **didn't actually know what they were writing**. You/ewe is a more striking example of this principle. They are phonetically identical, but differ when written in both spelling and meaning.\n\nSo when people \"write phonetically\" instead of following the rules of grammar, what they are conveying to everyone else is that they're faking literacy. If you don't think that matters, that's fine. It's not important for everyone to the same degree. However, as noted here, more and more communication is being done by writing in email, texts, status updates, posts, tweets, etc. If you want to be understood immediately in such media, you need to be clear with your message.\n\nYou can think of this as an analogy as well. When there were few roads and even fewer cars, all that mattered was that a person could operate their vehicle without causing damage to property or life. As more roads and cars came into being, and thus became common among all people, standardized rules had to be followed for safe and effective use of the roads. If you can drive a car, but can't pass the written driver's test, you don't get a license most places. The reason is that you have shown you lack an actual understanding of the rules of the road and/or proper operation of a motor vehicle. We don't have licensing for language, thankfully, but when you display that similar lack of understanding in the written medium, many if not most people see you as less credible and it gives your words less weight. Again, maybe that doesn't matter to you, but it's something to be aware of when discussing this subject.\n\nEdit: corrected a couple words.","score":-5,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

This implies doing what is best for future generations above all else.\n\nI agree that agency is important, but I'd argue that it is important because it is a means to an end. It is important to develop one's own character for the same reason it is important to raise your children well, and the same reason it is important to give people who are down on their luck a chance to develop themselves. In practice, it is generally easier to develop one’s own mind than to help others develop their minds, but there are a few important exceptions. Some people (authors, religious figures, leaders of cultural movements, etc) find themselves in a position to make a small improvement in our entire culture. The *simple* ideas spread by people like Martin Luther King Jr and Gandhi have much greater net benefit than any *larger* improvements they could have made to their own character.\n\nThe counterpoint to this view is something called \"virtue ethics\". Basically, it's the idea that the world is too complicated to be able to find any universal goals. Instead, the best you can do is to pick certain virtues (either because you lack them or because you want to improve them) and work to develop yourself as a person. Virtue ethics holds that these virtues themselves are the only things that are intrinsically valuable, rather than what these virtues can be used to accomplish.","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

The problems with cloud gaming right now include unacceptable bandwidth and latency issues, and high server costs. Cloud VMs are a sorta-OKish idea and you can get VM/VPS services from all sorts of providers e.g. amazon, but why go through the hassle of forcing the remote desktop interface to be \"part of the cloud\" and run in your web browser when we already have reliable implementations of remote desktop communication that use programs rather than run in a web browser? I mean, people are doing it and it's cute, but it's not that practical.\n\nThe thing is, web browsers are actually somewhat unstable performance hogs compared to highly optimized computer programs. I think I'd rather run a stable computer program to establish a remote desktop, not to say this *won't* or hasn't in some form already been put in the cloud. It's just that as an industry insider, the stuff you're describing is all just stuff that's sorta been done and kinda worked and/or has various more practical ways of doing the thing in question.","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Or maybe our smart phones will be powerful enough to just synch the phone up to a monitor and keyboard and have an OS and file system by that point in time, effectively obsoleting the need for the laptop for routine computer use like word processing and internet surfing. I don't really know, although right now we don't have quite the technology and infrastructure for these ideas to be the best way to go yet.\n\nTo be honest, this is one of those issues where the rubber meets the road -- cloud ideas could go from \"meh\" to \"great!\" if our ISPs were forced to upgrade the infrastructure, and weren't working to build monopolies and engage in anticompetitive practices that allow them to leave internet access ten years in the past, but I'll believe in it when I see it.

The cable modem they provided as-is was faulty, and I had to buy a new one.\n\nThe connection starts failing and having repeated outages at random times every day, and the latency on the wired cable internet connection is far too high for me to play games without considerable problems.\n\nI think this is not representative of America, completely -- but the current state of affairs where I live, which is a major city hub, is downright awful, whereas everywhere else is *just* backwards. When I was on ADSL in Lubbock, Texas, it was actually far better, at least I was able to play multiplayer games and didn't have constant outages, even if the down and up speeds were lower. Also, my friend in a tiny little town in Arkansas has reliable fast fiber, and it's crazy that this major telecom city center is so utterly backwards. Because my profession is internet centric, very bad internet is actually a significant incentive for me to leave this city.\n\nIt's a total joke. But I can't get anything else where I live, except for the AT&amp;T ADSL which is actually even worse. Essentially, they know they have me by the balls, there is no competitor to go to (other than AT&amp;T, which is actually worse, although I may go back to the stone age with AT&amp;T out of spite and because of the comcast/twc merger proposal).

It's a valuable (as in, business-saving) rule of thumb: If one person says the soup is salty, bet that a hundred others do, too, but said nothing. But the soup is still salty, all the same, and some of those people will simply never come back, and you won't get their money, and you'll never know why. So you have to take plausible complaints seriously, because each one is worth a hundred other unvoiced opinions. If it would ever matter, then you've got to take it seriously.\n\nYou may well not care if you come across to a lot of people are having an annoying habit. Perhaps it does not matter to you. That's your right, and your choice. But if it ever would, then the fact that you may only hear it once in awhile should not be mistaken for it being a rare viewpoint. It's much more likely that most other people are just nicer than I am. I have a habit and reputation of speaking unpleasant truths, because unlike most people I don't give a shit what others think about me personally. And the reason I do it is that if you're never made aware of it, you'll never change it. You'd want to know that you have bad breath, right?

That is when a process says I'm reading memory on a pointer to `0x0326a310` that isn't an address of a byte of physical memory, it's in a virtual address space unique to that process.  If another process tries reading `0x0326a310` its meaningless; that page more likely than won't translate to any physical address in a different process. The OS assigns pages (large chunks) of memory to processes as necessary and does the translation between virtual address space and physical memory addresses without giving applications any method to directly access physical memory or the memory of other processes (unless you specifically set aside pages to be shared via interprocess communication -- but again you have to go out of your way to do that).\n\n&amp;nbsp;^1  The point of its own malloc is the scheme for how memory allocation happens.  When does OpenSSL ask the OS for more pages of memory?  How does it split up those pages of memory?  How does it mark a section of memory used and how does it mark it as free to be allocated to some other variable?  How does it prevent fragmentation (e.g., having lots of spaces between used variables) and also prevent excessively long searches for a good spot to allocate a new variable?)","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Is it possible that the sleep phase might allow for these built-up charges to break down so that the stuff between the synapses can conduct the signal properly again? \n\nI guess then the defining question would be \"Does the electrolytic fluid that(as I understand it) exists between the neurons build and retain an electron charge after excessive or continuous use?\"...\n\nAnyone around here know much about that stuff?","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}
