According to this theory, as a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness. Brickman and Campbell coined the term in their essay \"Hedonic Relativism and Planning the Good Society\" (1971). During the late 1990s, the concept was modified by Michael Eysenck, a British psychologist, to become the current \"hedonic treadmill theory\" which compares the pursuit of happiness to a person on a treadmill, who has to keep working just to stay in the same place.\n\n---\n\n[^(**Picture**)](http://i.imgur.com/PPQicSH.jpg)\n\n[^(image source)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Honeywell_round_thermostat.jpg) ^| [^(about)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| *^(/u/GallantChicken can reply with 'delete'.

Yes, there are probably larger problems, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't address this one until the others are fixed, because that assumes they can come to a definitive solution, and other larger ones won't pop up.\n\nAs for why you should care, it starts with respect. Most people believe in the golden rule and equal opportunities for all people. If you believe in these things as well, the next step is saying, \"I want to do what I can to stop people from being treated unfairly.\" Then, you will discover that women are being treated unfairly all the time, and you will set out to stop that oppression. Poof, you're a feminist.\n\nFinally, SRS is against more than just sexism. It also targets racism, ableism, homophobia, and transphobia, to name a few.","score":8,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

UPC, RDS and Romtelecom. Romtelecom is the former state-owned telecom company (prior to the fall of communism in 89). UPC and RDS are relatively new arrivals (in the last 10-15 years). UPC and RDS have tried a merger about 5 years ago but they were denied that and laws were put in place to prevent it.\n\nStill, they began splitting up the market and creating influence zones. The providers rarely have areas of distribution that overlap and it's a pain to switch, especially if you're not in a large city.\n\nThat being said, they fight it out in terms of connection speeds and infrastructure. In the past 3 or so years, they have gone from a maximum of 100Mbps connections being sold to 200, 500 and ultimately 1Gbps from RDS, which the others are trying to achieve too ASAP. This competition is ultimately good for the consumer. \n\nI grew up with dial-up. Then switched to broadband and saw speeds increase phenomenally in the past decade. It's amazing how fast the Internet works here, even without maxing out your connection.\n\nAs far as mobile networks go, 4G is not yet implemented country-wide, only in important cities. But mobile network (3G at least) is fast and reliable enough. For example, last summer I was trekking up a semi-remote mountain and could browse the web for directions in the middle of nowhere.\n\nCompanies have to *want* to improve.

Uploading however does not need to involve creating a perfect copy divorced from the original. \n\nImagine uploading wherein your brain is linked in with several other electronic storage/processing units, essentially becoming one 'drive' in an array with mirrored data spread across the drives in such a way that no one drive has all the data, but the loss of any one drive wouldn't cause loss of data, essentially a RAID array using your orriginal brain as one of the drives, as you accumulate new memories they're spread across the array but not saved in your original brain.

The added benefit is that you don't forget the whole-word passwords.\n\nMy point is that for an algorithm that doesn't know better, Randall's point stands.  An algorithm designed for the whole word approach would obviously be better equipped to handle it.

That form came into medieval Latin as melongena, which was used in the botanical works of Tournefort and Linnaeus.

The words are: *[shit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit)*, *[piss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine)*, *[fuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck)*, *[cunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunt)*, *[cocksucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellatio)*, *[motherfucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherfucker)*, and *[tits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast)*.\n\n&gt;At the time, the words were considered highly inappropriate and unsuitable for broadcast on the public airwaves in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), whether radio or television. As such, they were avoided in scripted material, and [bleep censored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleep_censor) in the rare cases in which they were used; broadcast standards differ in different parts of the world, then and now, although most of the words on Carlin's original list remain [taboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo) on American [broadcast television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_television) as of 2014. The list was not an official enumeration of forbidden words, but rather was compiled by Carlin. Nonetheless, a radio broadcast featuring these words led to a [U.S. Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) [decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission_v._Pacifica_Foundation) that helped establish the extent to which the federal government could regulate speech on broadcast television and radio in the United States.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/FJ7S6zD.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Seven_Dirty_Words_WBAI.jpg) - *A poster in a WBAI broadcast booth which warns radio broadcasters against using the Seven Dirty Words.*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^George ^Carlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin) ^| [^Profanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity) ^| [^Obscenity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity) ^| [^Fuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ckclqod) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+ckclqod)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

The key is that if you increase the mass of the star you are increase the pressure and temperature in the core of the stare and thus the rate of fusion. Typically only the core of the star is actually fusing anything. So all that extra mass in the outer layers of the star is adding to the pressure but its not burnable. \n\nThere's some fun thermodynamics that goes into play in determining what the core will be like. If I remember correctly: In the really massive stars the temperature gradient from the core outward is very shallow and it can not support convection. Without convection gas does not get churned from the outer layers to the inner, so that inner core does not get hydrogen replenished. In those small, cool, red stars however there is a steep temperature gradient and there is convection from the core all the way to the surface so the star gets to burn all the hydrogen it has. Thus they get extremely long lifetimes. ","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

This is interesting because it shows patterns in what comics are referenced and how they get to be referenced that much. \n\nThis chart shows the interesting result comics are referenced more simply because they are referenced more, because more people are exposed to the comic.

{"author":"exDM69","created_date":"2014-10-16 05:44:22","body":"I am a racing geek and I enjoy a lot of different motor sport disciplines. I often find myself in a discussion about \"unlimited racing class\" because a lot of people who don't follow racing don't know that in the 1960s and 1970s there were very little restrictions and it was quickly found out that that's a very bad idea.\n\nnote: Some hillclimb competitions still have a virtually unlimited class but the speeds are usually restricted by the fear of death caused by running up a mountainside with a steep cliff you'll fall down if screw up.\n\nBut if there were an \"unlimited racing class\" and I was a race car engineer, the first thing to do would be to get rid of the human driver in the car. That's 60-70 kg (racing drivers are skinny) of useless meatbag in the cockpit. There's probably another 100-200kg or so of safety equipment (helmet, crash structure, roll hoop/cage) as well as excess of chassis surrounding the driver. Computer assisted remote control should easily beat a meatbag at the wheel.\n\nAt this point someone usually suggests that it's a stupid idea, but if you have to put a human in (and bring them back alive), it's no longer \"unrestricted\".\n\nAnother issue would be safety of the audience, because you can build a 400km/h (has been done at LeMans' Mulsanne straight before) car that corners at 10G+, but if you suffer a tyre blowout or something goes wrong, the audience is at peril. If it has to be safe for the audience, it's no longer \"unrestricted\".\n\nFinally there's the question of whether the racing vehicles must touch the ground or not. I'd *love* to see a Wipeout -style scifi racing league but I'm not sure that with current technology we could beat a high-powered, high-downforce car with slick racing tyres if the goal is to run around typical, existing race tracks (especially ones with right hand corners too).\n\n**tl;dr:** unrestricted racing is a stupid idea. If you insist, you can go watch footage of 1970s Can-Am races, or late-70's ground effect F1 cars, 80's turbo-era rallying or F1. But viewer discretion is adviced: there were driver and audience fatalities.","score":31,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

{"author":"Wyboth","created_date":"2014-10-31 13:19:45","body":"A. Car A, because of Newton's second law. Both cars feel the same force, but car B has a lower mass than car A, so its acceleration is greater. Therefore, it will cross the finish line first.\n\nB. Kinetic energy equals 0.5mv^2 . To find the final velocity, use the equation vf^2 = vo^2 + 2ad. Using Newton's second law, since the forces are the same for both, we can determine that car B's acceleration is 1.25 times greater than car A's acceleration (if we assume each car has 1 N of force, then car A's acceleration is 1 m/s^2 and car B's acceleration is 1.25 m/s^2 . Divide car B's acceleration by car A's acceleration, and you get how many times greater it is than car A's acceleration. It doesn't matter what number we picked for the force, since it's a ratio). Since car B's acceleration is 1.25 times greater than car A's acceleration, to make things easy, we'll say car B accelerates at 1.25 m/s^2 , and car A accelerates at 1 m/s^2 (it doesn't matter what numbers we pick, it only matters that B's acceleration is 1.25 times A's acceleration). Now we go back to the Big 4 equation vf^2 = vo^2 + 2ad, where vf is final velocity, vo is original velocity, a is acceleration, and d is distance traveled (1 meter for both, in this case). Since the problem states the cars start from rest, vo will be 0 for both cars. Now, the equation becomes vf^2 = 2 * a * 1. For car A, we substitute in an acceleration of 1 m/s^2, and solve for a final velocity of radical 2 (the square root of 2) m/s. For car B, the final velocity is radical 2.5. Now, finally, we can go back to the kinetic energy equation KE = 0.5mv^2. For car A, it's KE = 0.5 * 1 * sqrt(2)^2 = 1 J. For car B, KE = 0.5 * 0.8 * sqrt(2.5)^2 = 1 J. They are the same, so the third choice is correct.\n\nC. Momentum is mass times velocity. We were given both masses, and we solved for a final velocity based on our assumed acceleration (again, the actual numbers don't matter, what matters is that they follow the ratio), so this is easy. Car A's momentum is 1 * sqrt(2) = 1.414. Car B's momentum is 0.8 * sqrt(2.5) = 1.265. Car A has the greater momentum.\n\nIf you're confused about anything, let me know.","score":3,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Several of his responses are his standard Q&amp;A answers he gives really well at his talks on YouTube (the oldest from over five years ago that I recall), yet Colbert seemed like he stepped all over them. He'd ask questions and Randall would give an obvious set-up for a joke, and Colbert would then cut him off before the punchline.\n\nExample of what I mean. He talks about the ball pitched at 0.9c and he starts talking about the fusion going on and shockwave and science science science...but before he can say, \"And according to the rulebook, the batter would be considered hit by pitch\" Colbert cuts him off (or the editor did). It stomped all over the joke.\n\nThe result was that Randall came off as nervous, quiet, introverted, unfunny, and serious. If I hadn't seen his Q&amp;As, I would probably walk away having seen that thinking that's what he's like. I think if he'd had more breathing room or even if they'd cut a few of the questions to let Randall fully answer them, it would've played much better.\n\nAgain, I don't blame Randall at all. He seemed a little nervous but no more than I've seen other authors in interviews. I also don't blame Colbert per se because he had points he needed to hit in a specific time limit.

For example, if the sampling rate of an audio signal is 44100 Hz and there is a large peak in the cepstrum whose quefrency is 100 samples, the peak indicates the presence of a pitch that is 44100/100 = 441 Hz.

Note that a pure sine wave should not be used to test the cepstrum for its pitch determination from quefrency as a pure sine wave does not contain any harmonics.

It states that for every indexed [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_sets)  of [nonempty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonempty) sets there exists an indexed family  of elements such that  for every . The axiom of choice was formulated in 1904 by [Ernst Zermelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Zermelo) in order to formalize his proof of the [well-ordering theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-ordering_theorem). \n\n&gt;Informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of bins, each containing at least one object, it is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each bin. In many cases such a selection can be made without invoking the axiom of choice; this is in particular the case if the number of bins is finite, or if a selection rule is available: a distinguishing property that happens to hold for exactly one object in each bin. To give an informal example, for any (even infinite) collection of pairs of shoes, one can pick out the left shoe from each pair to obtain an appropriate selection, but for an infinite collection of pairs of socks (assumed to have no distinguishing features), such a selection can be obtained only by invoking the axiom of choice.\n\n&gt;Although originally controversial, the axiom of choice is now used without reservation by most mathematicians,  and it is included in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice ([ZFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFC)), the standard form of [axiomatic set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_set_theory). One motivation for this use is that a number of generally accepted mathematical results, such as [Tychonoff's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonoff%27s_theorem), require the axiom of choice for their proofs. Contemporary set theorists also study axioms that are not compatible with the axiom of choice, such as the [axiom of determinacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_determinacy). The axiom of choice is avoided in some varieties of [constructive mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(mathematics\\)), although there are varieties of constructive mathematics in which the axiom of choice is embraced.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image from article**](https://i.imgur.com/f5aXMyG.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Venn_A_intersect_B.svg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Axiom ^of ^countable ^choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_countable_choice) ^| [^Axiom ^of ^Choice ^\\(band)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_Choice_\\(band\\)) ^| [^Axiom ^of ^global ^choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_global_choice) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ck9ry0q) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+ck9ry0q)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","score":3,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

In standard, every day social interactions are driven by the past weight of thousands of years of genetic and memetic evolution, and will be influenced by what you know about the individual, what you want out of the interaction, and what you think you might get out of the interaction based on what you know about the individual.

{"author":"Dr_David","created_date":"2014-02-17 13:46:00","body":"I'd love to learn more about how a pulsar could ever get spinning that fast. Sure, the pulsar has energy, but it's not like the energy it's creating is making it rotate in and of itself... Right? Or am I being ignorant about this..?\n\nI mean, I can understand how stars start to spin -- it's part of the accretion disc; as particles, it's already spinning due to inertial forces, so why would the star that's formed move any more slowly.. BUT, how do you get something that's spinning at a relatively normal speed and bump that up to something that a science-fiction writer might be embarrassed to suggest as the velocity of an object?\n\nEdit: Ok, so I googled it, and found this site: http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/geas/lectures/lecture25/slide03.html  It's a decent explanation, although it's still hugely amazing that it can spin so fast..","score":3,"subreddit":"xkcd"}
