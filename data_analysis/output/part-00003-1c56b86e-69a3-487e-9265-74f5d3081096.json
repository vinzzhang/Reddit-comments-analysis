Then, it looks to match the *same* number of x characters some (integer) number of times (this is the \\1).  For example, if it matched xxx then it seeks to find xxx or xxxxxx or xxxxxxxxx, and so on.  Finally, it must find the start and end of the string (^ and $)—it has to make sure that it's using the *whole* string.\n\nThat portion of the regex will match any string that has a composite number of x characters—the number of characters can be written as M\\*N, so it will first match xx+ to xxxxx (M times), then it will match \\\\1+ to the remaining characters (M\\*(N-1) characters).  If there was a prime number of x characters then this is not possible.\n\nThe final trick is the ?! at the beginning, which looks to find a match of what follows it and causes the regex to *fail* to match in that case.","score":6,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

There isn't enough fresh content to vote on. Whatever is newest posted is pretty much guaranteed to end up at the top.\n\nDeleting content I therefore consider the least desirable course of action.\n\n&gt; *Hopefully* everyone will see the new rule and I won't have to remove anything.\n\nThat would be ideal, yes.\n\nThe problem only arises when reality fails to live up to this ideal.\n\n&gt; I'm on about 4-5 hours daily. The first thing I check is this sub and its modqueue. I understand that I can't be on all the time to delete these posts. I'm going to try my best to catch them before they get too big.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that by the time you log in the original poster may very well have already logged out. If you delete their post they may not be online to recreate it properly until a day or more later.\n\n---\n\nBest of luck modding.","score":0,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

This interaction will be done immediately, and they will never have another opportunity to affect you; from a causal decision theory standpoint (a.k.a. traditional Von-Neumann-Morgenstern game theory), there's no reason to cooperate. And yet humans reliably split the money in the ultimatum game approximately evenly, even while anonymous. There is no causal reason why they should do this; reputation effects are shielded off and it's not going to be repeated, so it has no lasting effects except how much money you get. Nevertheless, we refuse unbalanced splits and offer balanced ones. Something other than actual potential consequences to you is being considered here, and that means that necessarily we are using a simple version of acausal decision theory.\n\nThat's the thing about acausal reasoning; it sounds like outlandish science fiction, but it's just a formalization of long traditions of thought. Every time you act on a Kantian moral framework, you're using acausal reasoning: \"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\" is almost explicitly acausal.\n\nAlso, the other half of acausal reasoning is the *simulation* half, where we are modeling other people in our head to determine how to present ideas to them. And \"what you think you might get out of the interaction based on what you know about the individual\" is exactly that; a partial simulation of the other person which you're using to make your own decisions.\n\n(Sidenote: Our ultimatum game behavior is also why Roko's Basilisk could never work; we naturally refuse blackmail.)","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

If nothing else, it'll help me gain more experience and that's enough but (no offense to floern) I believe I can truly develop an app that looks more appealing to the regular user.\n\nAs for the special comics, I just checked and they are individually styled in html and css to act as they do. Unless I do the same and update the app every time such a special comic comes out, this might no be possible (there is an html view element in Android which I could use to possibly make it work, no promises).\n\nThe alternative timelines are a great idea and I could very possibly do something like that if I had access to a server that the app could use and I could update regularly to match more comics. This one might be a little hard for me right now. Fingers crossed for a future update though.\n\nAnd if you've got more suggestions, I'm all about whatever you've got to say.

If you look at a book and plot the number of times words are used vs how often they are used you find they follow the same relationship (no matter what language). That's pretty cool right? This is called Zipf's Law. It's been suggested that the source of this law is a balance between minimal effort on the part of speakers to impart meaning and minimal effort for listeners to understand meaning. Languages evolved to follow this law because this way people using the languages are required to use the least amount of energy to communicate with each other.

It was directed by [Doug Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Church) with [Warren Spector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Spector) serving as producer. The game is set aboard a space station in a [cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk) vision of the year 2072. Assuming the role of a nameless [hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(computer_security\\)), the player attempts to hinder the plans of a malevolent artificial intelligence called [SHODAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHODAN).\n\n&gt;*System Shock'*s [3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics) engine, physics simulation and complex gameplay have been cited as both innovative and influential. The developers sought to build on the [emergent gameplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_gameplay) and immersive environments of their previous games, *[Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Underworld:_The_Stygian_Abyss)* and *[Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Underworld_II:_Labyrinth_of_Worlds)*, by streamlining their mechanics into a more \"integrated whole\".\n\n&gt;Critics praised *System Shock* and hailed it as a major breakthrough in its genre. It was later placed on multiple hall of fame lists. The game was a moderate commercial success, with sales exceeding 170,000 copies; but Looking Glass ultimately lost money on the project. A sequel, *[System Shock 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock_2)*, was released by Looking Glass Studios and off-shoot developer [Irrational Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_Games) in [1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_in_video_gaming). The [2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_in_video_gaming) game *[Deus Ex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex)* and the [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_in_video_gaming) game *[BioShock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock)* are [spiritual successors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_successor) to the two games.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/jvIyb9W.jpg) [^(i)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sysshock.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^System ^Shock ^\\(novel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock_\\(novel\\)) ^| [^Shock ^System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_System) ^| [^System ^Shock ^2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock_2) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ckpdolg) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+ckpdolg)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

{"author":"FallenMatt","created_date":"2014-02-04 08:05:28","body":"I would most definitely disagree on that definition. I would say friend zoning is the situation where a male tries to date a woman only to be refused on the reason that \"it would ruin our friendship/we are better off as friends\". Friend zoning is the name given to this because it relegates the man to \"the friend zone\". Some men believe that this is in fact just a ploy because the girl doesn't see you as a sexual partner and performing certain actions will remove you from this \" friend zone\". There's a lot of objectifying and other stuff involved as well but let's not get into this.\n\nNow I don't agree with this at all. It's a perfectly acceptable reason to turn someone down because you don't seem them as a partner, and really you don't need any reason apart from the fact you don't want to  date someone. However many guys treat this refusal as something more than it is and attach feelings of dread and un-acceptance to the zone. \n\nIt seems to me that the culture around friend zone is firmly rooted in a man propositioning a woman. For whatever reasons (partly where it may be because of the assumption that it is a mans job to chase and for women to be chased but it is not soley this) it is viewed that when a friend zoning occurs it will be directed at a man. It's just not imagined for the situation to be reversed in popular media. ","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

There is a very wide gulf between \"admins getting personally involved in daily dramatic minutiae\" and permitting holocaust deniers to hijack your website. Back during the \"jailbait\" scandal, the Reddit Party Line was that prohibiting pedophiles from running a creepshots-of-children ring would open the gates to jackbooted censorship. Turns out, it didn't. And it wouldn't here, either.\n\nEither way, the system here didn't really \"resolve itself;\" there was no internal balancing force at play. All signs are that the dude simply forgot his bi-monthly shitpost to keep that account active. To point to that and say, \"look, the system worked!!!\" is disingenuous.\n\nAnd it would be possible to create a truly self-resolving system. They could implement a \"recall\" feature by which X% of requests would trigger a vote. If that's too much, they could change the /r/redditrequest rules. As it stands, one post anywhere on the site every sixty days is enough to be considered an active moderator of *any and every* subreddit you possess. Changing that to something more reasonable--say, one post every two weeks in the subreddit in question--would go a long way towards discouraging squatters.","score":9,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

The phenomenon was first investigated and described by Luke Howard in the 1810s, although he was not the one to name the phenomenon. The temperature difference usually is larger at night than during the day, and is most apparent when winds are weak. UHI is most noticeable during the summer and winter. The main cause of the urban heat island effect is from the modification of land surfaces, which use materials that effectively store short-wave radiation.
