If I select 3 words at random from my system dictionary of ~99000 words, one single word has around 17 bits of entropy giving me 51 total bits, which pretty decent. Similarly, the comic uses 4 words from a smaller dictionary size of at most 2048 words (11 bits each) for 44 total bits of entropy. I'd guess that most people select from a *far* smaller set of words, perhaps only a few hundred, and shoot themselves in the foot using this password scheme incorrectly.

You have no declared yourself too cool for people who think they're too cool for things that are popular.  You understand the world better than people who claim to understand the world better than the average person. \n\nYou've somehow managed to come to the conclusion that Munroe is Fedora, when anyone who's read more than a few xkcd comics know that he is in fact Cueball.

You've chosen to read things that aren't there, clearly misunderstanding what you've read, or else purposely making things up for the sole purpose of tearing them down to show how much more advanced you are.\n\nNow go ahead; respond to me, telling me I just don't \"get it\" and how you can see things for how they really are.

Arizona completely ignores DST. Saskatchewan doesn't bother, but already is ahead an hour for its longitude. Most of Africa and Asia and half of South America don't bother. \n\nPlus, there are two different general periods of DST worldwide, since there are two different summers (north vs. south hemisphere).\n\nNot everyone even agrees on when DST/\"summer time\" starts. The U.S. unilaterally changed it a few years ago, but not everyone else did. For example, US DST starts on the second Sunday in March; but UK's BST starts on the *last* Sunday in March. Some shift at a certain time UTC while others (like the U.S.) shift at a certain *local* time. Some shift on Sunday while others shift on the previous Friday.\n\nFrankly, time zones simply aren't as neatly delineated as the comic makes them out to be. They are *generally* 30 degree longitude segments, but in actual use, the lines veer wildly from those nice neat paths, in some cases there are latitudes at which a given time zone doesn't actually exist. In some cases places use completely different time zones from the ones their longitudes would prescribe (e.g. Saskatchewan and most of Russia, which are an hour away; and elongated communities such as the Aleutians or other Pacific island chains). And then there's some places in e.g. India and Australia that observe *half hour* shifted time zones (e.g. to the west is 7PM, to the east is 9PM, and right here is 8:30PM).\n\n**TL;DR:** I think we get what we get.","score":3,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

The sperm diffuse through the female's [hemolymph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolymph), reaching the ovaries and resulting in fertilization. The process is detrimental to the female's health. It creates an open wound which impairs the female until it heals, and is susceptible to infection. The injection of sperm and [ejaculatory fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen) into the hemocoel can also trigger an [immune reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_reaction) in the female. [Bed bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_bug), which reproduce solely by traumatic insemination, have evolved a pair of sperm-receptacles, known as the [spermalege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermalege). It has been suggested that the spermalege reduces the direct damage to the female bed bug during traumatic insemination. However, statistical experiments showed no conclusive evidence for that hypothesis; hygienic protection against bacteria being the preferred explanation for that organ. \n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/yjaYXKw.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Traumatic_insemination_1_edit1.jpg) - *A male bed bug \\(Cimex lectularius\\) traumatically inseminates a female bed bug \\(top\\).

It streams games to you in real-time (whereas console servers just do part of the work for you). Frankly, it's far from ideal. The unavoidable lag is barely bearable, and the quality is far from what you can get at home (for a fee). With gigabit speeds, quality could increase, but lag will always remain an issue unless some sort of physically-near-the-home network of virtual machines service come to exists.\n\nThose are my thoughts so far, but yes, the benefits are there and it's very likely to become mainstream at some point.

Web is often thin-client, but even a thin client has to download and run scripts -- and there's actually nothing stopping you from making a thin-client non-web application.\n\nI guess the idea of having very small, fast apps behave like they have no installation process is kind of cute, and it's true that web based apps can have the real work installed and carried by a server, but the problem with bypassing the app installation process is that most apps can cost money and/or need permission from the user to query data from the phone or user or other data, and an important part of the installation is making sure users consent to that (at least on Android). And maintaining the user-specific state of an installed application the user paid for, but doing it all in the cloud introduces another layer of maintenance albeit it's doable, but I'd rather they just let an app be an app and let its developers focus on improving it instead of introducing more layers of maintenance by making it \"cloud!\", at least right now.\n\nSo yeah -- I pretty much completely agree with you.","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

It's another when a stranger does. \n\nOther times it's a question that an otherwise well-written article or documentary left unaddressed. Of course, no one is blatantly *rude* in a reply. They might be in disagreement, but not rude. A reply in and of itself is a courtesy; they're all courteous by definition. And I don't  bother e-mailing people I outright disagree with. That's just begging strangers for an argument. I typically agree with everything *but*, or everything *but you didn't answer this*. \n\nOne funny example was to a particular theoretical physicist who was working on time travel with lasers and 'bending space' and what-not. It all sounded incredibly scientific - and of course, lasers - but when he appeared on Through the Wormhole with a 'mockup model' of his 'potential time travel machine' and he was considered a *serious physicist*.. I had to ask him how that whole project was going, and whether any new discoveries had occurred in the field. I did it sincerely of course, but I basically knew what the answer would be. \n\nHe responded basically with a long-winded plea for money, in the hopes that I was some rich potential investor. He dodged around the question of any work he actually does and just basically said 'give me a million dollars; I can do it then'. I'm serious: He said something like \"I estimate we'll need 1 million to complete this project\". It really typified exactly how little I trust shows like that to be bearers of 'science', much less Morgan Freeman.  \n\nI think my favorite response from a 'random' celebrity was Nicholas Gurewitch, who makes [Perry Bible Fellowship](http://pbfcomics.com/). There's this over-arching theme in a lot of his comics that paint the fairer sex as traitorous - the subject of the comic gets cheated on all the time by one woman or another. I can't remember how I worded the question, but it was basically along the lines of 'Is this a personal thing for you, or are those comics more along the lines of satirizing society?'. In hindsight it was probably a rude question but I had been cheated on myself near those days. He responded with a single word: \"Personal.\" \n\nAlways felt bad for the guy after, and those cheater comics stuck out like sore thumbs. He got hurt hard and it shows.

{"author":"Fordiman","created_date":"2014-12-24 19:45:39","body":"Ok, let's do some math.\n\nLet's assume that Santa needs to accelerate and decelerate back to zero for every stop one [article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/6859529/Father-Christmass-Christmas-Eve-in-figures.html) reasons that he has 32 hours to visit 700,000,000 Christians in a night, with a total distance of 342,510,000 km (this is not a travelling salesman solution, and the world is a \"square map\" for the number, so there's a good chance this is a vast overestimate).  \n\nAssuming that Santa's MO is to instantly teleport cookies and milk to the sleigh while simultaneously teleporting presents under trees, we'll say the entirety of his trip is consumed in travel - giving us a speed of 2,973 km/s - about 1/1000th the speed of light.  This is good, because it means we're far enough from c to largely ignore relativistic effects (but not enough to ignore friction - so we'll leave that out for now.  No sense in imagining a burning Santa when we already accept this isn't a thing).\n\nLet's also pick a mass for Santa's sleigh.  Santa himself is a big guy - call him 150 kg (~330 lbs).  He's also got \"eight _tiny_ reindeer\", so we'll go with the low end of the mass of an adult female deer, or 80 kg each.  Let's assume the sleigh is lightweight (Santa will have to have shaved some mass off his sleigh as the population rose to keep up), and is a polycarbonate construction weighing in at a mere 50 kg.  So 840kg.\n\nSo, at a minimum, we would need 3.7e15 joules for each change in speed, or 7.43e15 joules per stop.  We'd need to be able to extract that from an average of one glass of milk and one cookie.\n\nMilk is 87% water, so we can be assured that an 8 oz glass contains at least ~25 mol of hydrogen atoms.  For the sake of simplicity, I'll assume that Santa's Mr. Fusion is very finely tuned - that is,\n\n* p + p -&gt; D (1.76 Mev)\n* D + D -&gt; T + p (4.03 MeV, p is recycled)\n* D + T -&gt; 4He + n (17.6 MeV, n is permitted to decay to p, and is recycled)\n\nSum reaction, accounting for recycling, is:\n* 4 * p -&gt; 4He (26.91 MeV, consuming 4 amu of fuel, for a power density of ~6.5e11 J/mol hydrogen)\n\n6.5e11 is kind of low; 25 mol of hydrogen would only get you to 1.62e13 J.  To power Santa's Sleigh, we'd need ~104kg of milk per house.  So we have to assume Santa's carrying his own fuel, but doesn't mind the help.  ","score":7,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

What actually happened was that California electoral law passed during the campaign finance reform *requires* anyone making a campaign contribution, even in miniscule amounts, to fill out a form disclosing their name and employer. Someone on a mission to discredit him went digging through old public records, and amongst the millions of dollars he has donated in his lifetime, $1000 of it happened to be towards a conservative political action group that supported Prop 8. *That's it*.\n\nThat isn't the same thing as a CEO making an ass of himself on Facebook. He took every reasonable step to keep his private political convictions private, short of anything unlawful. When he was required *by law* to fill out the form, he did so truthfully, and as a result lost his job because of privately-held political beliefs that he had gone out of his way to keep private.\n\n&gt; Was Eich fired because of his political affiliation itself or because of the negative PR resulting from said affiliation? And is there an appreciable legal difference between the two?\n\nYou'd have to ask [a California attorney](http://www.calbar.ca.gov/) that specializes in discrimination. \n\nGetting back to the topic, it's not that I feel Randall (author of xkcd) is necessarily *wrong* here, certainly nothing he said in the strip itself is inherently wrong, it's just that when he brings up legal or social issues he has a tendency to oversimplify them when they are far more complex than he seems to realize.

This is on the basis that curved paths are slower than straight ones and so we should maximise how much of a curve the fast raptors have to run by allowing the slow one to run straight. I think I've proved that that is actually a bad idea below, or at very least I've failed to show it's a good idea.~~\n\n~~Supposing you were to run directly away from the slowest raptor. Assuming that by 20m triangle Randall means a triangle with 20m edges that means the raptor would start h=√3/2a A=h/3 so 2A= 11.54 meters away  Using the above we know that that raptor would reach top speed in 2.5 seconds in which time it would have covered 12.5 meters, at this point you'd be 11.54+2.5*6 -12.5 = 14.04 meters away. It would then catch you after a further 10t=6t+14.04 =3.51 seconds in which time you would have run a further 3.51 * 6 = 21.06 meters for a total distance of 35.1 meters.~~\n\n~~In the meantime the 2 side raptors will have run a sort of lobsided hyperbolic path with its asymptotes at the start and finish points of your run. It will be considerably longer than the distance from the point they started to the point they eat you x^2 = 10^2 +(35.1 - height )^2 x= 31.0 meters but a tad shorter than running to you and then running to that point (31.0+11.54 = 42.5 meters) so a fair guess is it will be around 39 or so meters. In the first 6 seconds (which is what we've been dealing with) these raptors won't have reached max speed but will have run (at^2 )/2 = 72 meters. (Damn, my hope was to show that the side raptors couldn't travel that distance in that time, thus proving you should run away from the slowest raptor, but it turns out they can, easily. It turns out curved lines aren't that much slower than straight ones.)~~\n\n~~So the side raptors will definitely catch you first. **This suggests you are better off running at one of two angles pointed almost towards but a bit to the side of the slow raptor.** But I'm not sure how you'd calculate the hyperbolic paths the raptors would follow so I'm a bit stuck. You might be able to do it with vectors but I don't have time to have a go right now. As you are buying yourself microseconds at most I think \"a bit to the right or left of the slow one\" will do as an answer.~~\n\nEdit: I've realised this is the wrong way to go about it. I still don't know how to go about it but I've worked out how to make a reasonable estimation.\n\nYou start in the middle of an equilateral triangle of raptors. Whenever you run further away from one you  run closer towards the other two at least until you are outside the triangle. So you want to get out of the triangle as quickly as possible. This would suggest running towards one of the three closest tangents to the triangle. It would also be logical to pick one of the two sides featuring the slower raptor.\n\nThe raptors are identical in speed for the first 2.5 seconds which is about all we get which again suggests running pretty much straight in between them. If we did that then we can discount the raptor that we're running directly away from, that one isn't going to catch us. In the first 2.5 seconds we'd have run 2.5*6 = 15 meters which would put us about 10m outside the circle (15 - 5.77). in that time the raptors would have run (at^2 )/2 = 12.5 meters but will have done so in an outward spiral toward our new position. So if we divide by a bit less than pi to simulate the effect that has we can see it will have moved about 4 meters toward us (this is the way you estimate river length, generally speaking because rivers take a curved path they are about pi times longer than the direct distance from source to sea). So by seeing that we are at the apex of a new triangle 12.5 meters high and with a base of 20 meters and each raptor is about 4 meters along the side of the triangle we can see that the raptors are x^2 = 10^2 + 12.5^2 x-4 = 12 meters behind us.\n\nFrom that point the raptor's path is still curved but it is considerably straighter so let's simulate it as a straight line. It's the fast raptor that catches us obviously and it will do so after (at^2 )/2=12 +6t t=4.37 seconds. Slighly longer as the fast raptor reaches top speed just before it catches you but lets ignore that for now.\n\nSo in those circumstances we survive for 4.37+2.5=6.87 seconds. In that time the slow raptor can travel 12.5 (as calculated previously) + 10*4.37 = 56.2 meters and the fast raptor can travel 78.1 meters while it is still accelerating and then 15.5 meters during its half second at top speed for a total distance of 93.6 meters.\n\nSo the slow raptor runs about 37.9% ie about 40% of the total distance of the distance run by both raptors.\n\nWhile it is not exactly right due to the curves in their trajectories, this would provide an argument for running toward a point on the edge of the triangle which is 40% toward the slower raptor. Using trig  is a bit of a pain (you start from the sin rule and then have to solve 8/sin a = 11.4 / sin (180 -30 - a) )but we can work out that means **running at an angle of about 35.5 degrees to north**.\n\nNow that's pretty approximate but what you could then do is work through the problem again feeding in the 35.5 degrees to north at the start and use that to get a more accurate estimate for time survived and plug that new estimate in in turn to get a better idea of which way to run. Iterate that several times and it will start to get more accurate, much more so if you can plot the exact path of the raptors and cut out some of our cruder assumptions.\n\nThis is assuming you have to run in a straight line. In actual fact you'd probably be better off starting off running directly in between the two raptors and then slowly bearing north. If you survive that long carry on bearing round and run behind the slow raptor. It won't help very much. Even the slow raptor can catch you in a few seconds.\n\nEdit 2 [various people have brute forced it in python](http://fora.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=120&amp;start=40). They get various different answers between 28 and 32 degrees, which makes my rough estimation look pretty decent. It looks like you can only survive for about 4 seconds tho. Using pi to approximate the raptor running spirals was very optimistic.\n\n3 We need the floor plan, also are all the raptors injured now?","score":5,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

{"author":"Ian_Itor","created_date":"2014-05-09 09:48:51","body":"Not actually just heavier. This is highly theoretical (and maybe stuff for an what-if?), but every train on earth creates a force that \"rotates\" the earth. But since the earth's mass is larger by many orders of magnitude, it has no influence on earth at all.\n\nEven if the train had a weight that is at least comparable (as in 1-2 order of magnitude give or take) it still would not affect its tangential force (which is the force that makes the train move). So the engine would have to scale, too. It would have to overcome the earth's rotational force, depending on where it is. I don't even know if it could really make the earth turn, because it is in the same frame of reference (the earth including its atmoshpere), but according to the conservation of impulse it should theoretically be possible.","score":-1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}
