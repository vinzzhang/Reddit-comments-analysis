And then you can wonder if a certain character is a friendly super-intelligence or not.\n\nIf you do go down the path of reading Accelerando, there's also some other references that may be fun to read up on.\n\nFrom Accelerando:\n\n&gt; Not everything is sweetness and light in the era of mature nanotechnology. Widespread intelligence amplification doesn't lead to widespread rational behavior. New religions and mystery cults explode across the planet; much of the Net is unusable, flattened by successive semiotic jihads. India and Pakistan have held their long-awaited nuclear war: external intervention by US and EU nanosats prevented most of the IRBMs from getting through, but the subsequent spate of network raids and Basilisk attacks cause havoc. Luckily, infowar turns out to be more survivable than nuclear war – especially once it is discovered that a simple anti-aliasing filter stops nine out of ten neural-wetware-crashing Langford fractals from causing anything worse than a mild headache.\n\nThis is a reference to David Langord's short stories including [BLIT](http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/blit.htm), [Different Kinds of Darkness](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/different-kinds-of-darkness/), and [comp.basilisk faq](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v402/n6761/full/402465a0.html).\n\nI'd also toss [Implied Spaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_Spaces) by Walter Jon Williams in there (possibly after reading [Glasshouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasshouse_(novel)) by Stross - its based on the culture portrayed in the last chapter of Accelerando):\n\n&gt; \"I and my confederates,\" Aristide said, \"did our best to prevent that degree of autonomy among artificial intelligences.  We made the decision to turn away from the Vingean Singularity before most people even knew what it was.  But—\" He made a gesture with his hands as if dropping a ball.  \"—I claim no more than the average share of wisdom.  We could have made mistakes.\n\nAnd of course, that would lead you to [The Peace War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peace_War) and [Marooned in Realtime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marooned_in_Realtime) by Verner Vinge.\n\nSo, there's a nice reading list:\n\n* BLIT short stories by Langford (many published online)\n* Accelerando by Stross (creative commons)\n* Glasshouse by Stross\n* Implied Spaces by Williams\n* Across Realtime series by Vinge\n\nand oh yea...\n\n* Singularity Sky by Stross\n* Iron Sunrise by Stross","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

The WAY the number of references decrease is what's interesting.\n\n&gt; I defined x to be the number of references, and I defined C(x) to be the comic ranking\n\nThe X-axis (horizontal) is the popularity ranking of the comic. X = 1 means that this comic was referenced the most, x = 2 means the second most, and so on. The vertical axis corresponds to the total number of references. Clearly the most popular post will be referenced the most, this is trivial. However, we are interested in the relationship between total number of references and position ranking.\n\nTo be clear here, there isn't an \"independent variable\": we are comparing two variables about a comic (its ranking and the total number of times it has been referenced). However, because there is a definite order to these comics (there will always be a most referenced comic, and so on), so it makes sense to put these on the horizontal axis as it will exist independently of what specific comic is first.\n\n&gt;There is nothing interesting about taking some input z, transforming it via some known f(z), plotting w/ f(z) on the horizontal axis and z on the vertical axis and the remarking how amazing this relationship is.\n\nThen you have missed the point of this post.

For example, \"swan-road\" would imply \"ocean\". \n\n&gt;In more scholarly terms, a **kenning** is a type of literary trope, specifically circumlocution, in the form of a compound (usually two words, often hyphenated) that employs figurative language in place of a more concrete single-word noun. Kennings are strongly associated with Old Norse and later Icelandic and Anglo-Saxon poetry. For example, Old Norse poets might replace sverð, the regular word for “sword”, with a more abstract compound such as “wound-hoe” (Egill Skallagrímsson: Höfuðlausn 8), or a genitive phrase such as randa íss “ice of shields” (Einarr Skúlason: ‘Øxarflokkr’ 9).

The subreddit belongs to the mod(s), like it or not. The mods can drive all the users away, or attract more, but unless they do something actually illegal or against the most important rules of reddiquette, they're there to stay. \n\n&gt;it is pretty fucking clear the majority of /r/xkcd doesn't like /u/soccer's moderating decisions.\n\nUnder 300 people have upvoted this post and the petition at the time I'm posting this response, about 10 hours after the , /r/XKCD has over 44,000 subscribers. Majority?

Reddit is a popularity contest for mods. Mods can make or break a subreddit at any time. Submitters come and go. Consider /u/DrJulianBashir/. He used to submit 5 or 10 things a day, now he's down to 1 or 2 a week. The subreddits he used to submit to have all survived quite nicely. Submitters and subscribers are only significant as numbers; they are easily replaced if the sub is popular, and the mods can affect that orders of magnitude more than the users. Reddit is a microcosm of society. If the manager of your local pub and you don't get along but lots of people go there and don't seem to have a problem with him, you're not going to get him fired unless you can prove he's breaking the law. The only recourse you have if you are a submitter and/or subscriber who doesn't like the mods is to ditch the subreddit. \n\n&gt; having a bitch about the subscribers calling out a mod is some serious hypocrisy\n\nI don't see how. I'm just telling you less than three hundred unhappy souls that there are better ways to spend your time. There is some bitching about /u/soccer every once in a while, but he remains. He may or may not believe in some of the stuff he posts, but he's smart enough to not break any rules that will get him thrown out. You folks go ahead and have your little circlejerk and downvote people that promote common sense if it makes you feel like you're making things better. All you are actually doing is giving /u/soccer a laugh. Some of you will figure things out eventually, some will never catch on.

We had no idea who asked what. It was a way of knowing what we’d screwed up. Lots of queries on a topic? Bad feature design.\n\n    One day one of the PMs in charge of monitoring Clippy’s logs found a story, told in fragments.\n\n    Somebody, probably a woman in the US Midwest, was typing a sentence at a time. Clippy would answer nonsensically. She’d type another one.\n\n    She’d lost her job. Her boyfriend was beating her. She was so lonely, and so afraid. All her waking nightmares, told to a paperclip.\n\n    We couldn’t help. We didn’t know who she was. We’d gone to great lengths to make sure that we COULD not know who she was.\n\n    So we read her story. One sentence after another.

{"author":"Kattzalos","created_date":"2014-12-03 09:56:54","body":"My favorite, from /r/badphilosophy:\n\nOn Twin Earth, a brain in a vat is at the wheel of a runaway trolley. There are only two options that the brain can take: the right side of the fork in the track or the left side of the fork. There is no way in sight of derailing or stopping the trolley and the brain is aware of this, for the brain knows trolleys. The brain is causally hooked up to the trolley such that the brain can determine the course which the trolley will take.\n\nOn the right side of the track there is a single railroad worker, Jones, who will definitely be killed if the brain steers the trolley to the right. If the railman on the right lives, he will go on to kill five men for the sake of killing them, but in doing so will inadvertently save the lives of thirty orphans (one of the five men he will kill is planning to destroy a bridge that the orphans' bus will be crossing later that night). One of the orphans that will be killed would have grown up to become a tyrant who would make good utilitarian men do bad things. Another of the orphans would grow up to become G.E.M. Anscombe, while a third would invent the pop-top can.\n\nIf the brain in the vat chooses the left side of the track, the trolley will definitely hit and kill a railman on the left side of the track, \"Leftie\" and will hit and destroy ten beating hearts on the track that could (and would) have been transplanted into ten patients in the local hospital that will die without donor hearts. These are the only hearts available, and the brain is aware of this, for the brain knows hearts. If the railman on the left side of the track lives, he too will kill five men, in fact the same five that the railman on the right would kill. However, \"Leftie\" will kill the five as an unintended consequence of saving ten men: he will inadvertently kill the five men rushing the ten hearts to the local hospital for transplantation. A further result of \"Leftie's\" act would be that the busload of orphans will be spared. Among the five men killed by \"Leftie\" are both the man responsible for putting the brain at the controls of the trolley, and the author of this example. If the ten hearts and \"Leftie\" are killed by the trolley, the ten prospective heart-transplant patients will die and their kidneys will be used to save the lives of twenty kidney-transplant patients, one of whom will grow up to cure cancer, and one of whom will grow up to be Hitler. There are other kidneys and dialysis machines available, however the brain does not know kidneys, and this is not a factor.\n\nAssume that the brain's choice, whatever it turns out to be, will serve as an example to other brains-in-vats and so the effects of his decision will be amplified. Also assume that if the brain chooses the right side of the fork, an unjust war free of war crimes will ensue, while if the brain chooses the left fork, a just war fraught with war crimes will result. Furthermore, there is an intermittently active Cartesian demon deceiving the brain in such a manner that the brain is never sure if it is being deceived.\n\n**QUESTION: What should the brain do?**","score":29,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

{"author":"EliezerYudkowsky","created_date":"2014-11-21 04:04:47","body":"(edited to make clear what this is all about)\n\nHi!  This is Eliezer Yudkowsky, original founder but no-longer-moderator of LessWrong.com and also by not-quite-coincidence the first AI In A Box Roleplayer Guy.  I am also the author of \"Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality\", a controversial fanfic which causes me to have a large, active Internet hatedom that does not abide by norms for reasoned discourse.  You should be very careful about believing any statement supposedly attributed to me that you have not seen directly on an account or page I directly control.\n\nI was brought here by a debate in the comments about \"Roko's Basilisk\" mentioned in 1450's alt tag.  Roko's Basilisk is a weird concept which a *false* Internet meme says is believed on LessWrong.com and used to solicit donations (this has never happened on LessWrong.com or anywhere else, ever).  The meme that this is believed on LessWrong.com or used to solicit donations was spread by a man named David Gerard who made over 300 edits to the RationalWiki page on Roko's Basilisk, though the rest of RationalWiki does seem to have mostly gone along with it.\n\nThe tl;dr on Roko's Basilisk is that a sufficiently powerful AI will punish you if you did not help create it, in order to give you an incentive to create it.\n\nRationalWiki basically invented Roko's Basilisk as a *meme* - not the original concept, but the meme that there's anyone out there who believes in Roko's Basilisk and goes around advocating that people should create AI to avoid punishment by it.  So far as I know, literally nobody has ever advocated this, ever.  Roko's original article basically said \"And therefore you SHOULD NOT CREATE [particular type of AI that Yudkowsky described that has nothing to do with the Basilisk and would be particularly unlikely to create it even given other premises], look at what a DANGEROUS GUY Yudkowsky is for suggesting an AI that would torture people that didn't help create it\" [it wouldn't].\n\nIn the hands of RationalWiki generally, and RationalWiki leader David Gerard particularly who also [wrote a wiki article smearing effective altruists that must be read to be believed](http://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Effective_altruism&amp;oldid=1316574), this somehow metamorphosed into a Singularity cult that tried to get people to believe a Pascal's Wager argument to donate to their AI god on pain of torture.  This cult that has literally never existed anywhere except in the imagination of David Gerard.\n\nI'm a bit worried that the alt text of XKCD 1450 indicates that Randall Munroe thinks that there actually *are* \"Roko's Basilisk people\" somewhere and that there's fun to be had in mocking them (another key part of the meme RationalWiki spreads), but this is an understandable mistake since Gerard et. al. have more time on their hands and have conducted a quite successful propaganda war.  With tacit cooperation from a Slate reporter who took everything in the RationalWiki article at face value, didn't contact me or anyone else who could have said otherwise, and engaged in that particular bit of motivated credulity to use in a drive-by shooting attack on Peter Thiel who was heavily implied to be funding AI work because of Basilisk arguments; to the best of my knowledge Thiel has never said anything about Roko's Basilisk, ever, and I have no positive indication that Thiel has ever heard of it, and he was funding AI work long long before then, etcetera.  And then of course it was something the mainstream media had reported on and that was the story.  I mention this to explain why it's understandable that Munroe might have bought into the Internet legend that there are \"Roko's Basilisk people\" since RationalWiki won the propaganda war to the extent of being picked up by a Slate reporter that further propagated the story widely.  But it's still, you know, disheartening.\n\nIt violates discourse norms to say things like the above without pointing out specific factual errors being made by RationalWiki, which I will now do.  Checking the current version of the Roko's Basilisk article on RationalWiki, virtually everything in the first paragraph is mistaken, as follows:\n\n&gt; Roko's basilisk is a proposition that says an all-powerful artificial intelligence from the future may retroactively punish those who did not assist in bringing about its existence.\n\nRoko's basilisk was the proposition that a self-improving AI that was sufficiently powerful could do this; all-powerful is not required.  Note hyperbole.\n\n&gt; It resembles a futurist version of Pascal's wager; an argument used to try and suggest people should subscribe to particular singularitarian ideas, or even donate money to them, by weighing up the prospect of punishment versus reward. \n\n**This sentence is a lie**, originated and honed by RationalWiki with the deliberate attempt to smear the reputation of what, I don't know, Gerard sees as an online competitor or something.  Nobody ever said \"Donate so the AI we build won't torture you.\"  I mean, who the bleep would think that would work even if they believed in the Basilisk thing?  Gerard made this up.\n\n&gt; Furthermore, the proposition says that merely knowing about it incurs the risk of punishment. \n\nThis is a bastardization of work that I and some other researchers did on Newcomblike reasoning in which, e.g., we proved mutual cooperation on the oneshot Prisoner's Dilemma between agents that possess each other's source code and are simultaneously trying to prove theorems about each other's behavior.  See http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5577  The basic adaptation to Roko's Basilisk as an infohazard is that if you're not even thinking about the AI at all, it can't see a dependency of your behavior on its behavior because you won't have its source code if you're not thinking about it at all.  This doesn't mean if you are thinking about it, it will get you; I mean it's not like you could prove things about an enormous complicated AI even if you did have the source code, and it has a resource-saving incentive to do the equivalent of \"defecting\" by making you believe that it will torture you and then not bothering to actually carry out the threat.  Cooperation on the Prisoner's Dilemma via source code simulation isn't easy to obtain, it would be easy for either party to break if they wanted, and it's only the common benefit of cooperation that establishes a motive for rational agents to preserve the delicate conditions for mutual cooperation on the PD.  There's no motive on your end to carefully carry out necessary conditions to be blackmailed.  (But taking Roko's premises at face value, his idea would zap people as soon as they read it.  Which - keeping in mind that at the time I had absolutely no idea this would all blow up the way it did - caused me to yell quite loudly at Roko for violating ethics given his own premises, I mean really, WTF?  You're going to get everyone who reads your article tortured so that you can argue against an AI proposal?   In the twisted alternate reality of RationalWiki, this became proof that I believed in Roko's Basilisk, since I yelled at the person who invented it without including twenty lines of disclaimers about what I didn't necessarily believe.   And since I had no idea this would blow up that way at the time, I suppose you could even read the sentences I wrote that way, which I did not edit for hours first because I had no idea this was going to haunt me for years to come.  And then, since Roko's Basilisk was a putatively a pure infohazard of no conceivable use or good to anyone, and since I didn't really want to deal with the argument, I deleted it from LessWrong which seemed to me like a perfectly good general procedure for dealing with putative pure infohazards that jerkwads were waving in people's faces.  Which brought out the censorship!! trolls and was certainly, in retrospect, a mistake.)\n\n&gt; It is also mixed with the ontological argument, to suggest this is even a reasonable threat. \n\nI have no idea what \"ontological argument\" is supposed to mean here.  If it's the ontological argument from theology, as was linked, then this part seems to have been made up from thin air.  I have never heard the ontological argument associated with anything in this sphere, except on this RationalWiki article itself.\n\n&gt; It is named after the member of the rationalist community LessWrong who most clearly described it (though he did not originate it).\n\nRoko did in fact originate it. Also, anyone can sign up for LessWrong.com, David Gerard has an account there but that doesn't make him a \"member of the rationalist community\".\n\nAnd that is just the opening paragraph.\n\nI'm a bit sad that Randall Monroe seems to possibly have jumped on this bandwagon - since it was started by people who were playing the role of jocks sneering at nerds, the way they also sneer at effective altruists, and having XKCD join in on that feels very much like your own mother joining the gang hitting you with baseball bats.  On the other hand, RationalWiki has conducted a very successful propaganda campaign here.  So it's saddening but not too surprising if Randall Monroe has never heard hinted any version but RationalWiki's.  I hope he reads this and reconsiders.","score":99,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

If a password has n^m possibilites, where *n* is the number of different tokens and *m* is the length of the string, it essentially raises *n* by about two orders of magnitude, minus some semantic biasing effects.

There aren't any rules saying you can't 'promote your own material', there just are rules surrounding how you're allowed to do so (Ex. *Not* through vote manipulation).\n\n&gt; In no right-thinking world would an anti-Semite holocaust denier be allowed to run an area of a website called /r/holocaust[1]\n\nWhy not? I don't like it either but it'd be no different then if he managed to register www.holocaust.com before anybody else (Unless you're one who'd rather government's remove websites from people if they don't like the content). Subreddit's aren't that different from separate websites, and are treated similarly. He gained the subreddit though legitimate means and held-on to it within the rules of being a subreddit moderator. Yes it pissed me off and I'm happy he's gone, but he wasn't breaking any rules.\n\nHonestly, the last thing we want is Reddit involved in subreddit politics anymore then they already are. They're hands-off because not every case is as 'clear-cut' as this one, and if they start removing moderators that *aren't* breaking any rules, things will get ugly in a hurry. Reddit would be opening themselves up to tons of \"Please remove this head-mod because they aren't doing anything, or doesn't agree with this stance, or etc.\", and instead of being able to respond \"Reddit doesn't get involved in subreddit politics\", now that response really means \"Sorry, that head-mod isn't bad enough to be removed\".\n\nAgain, perhaps the /r/holocaust seems like an \"Obvious\" situation, but what about a subreddit like /r/abortion? Who should get to control that subreddit, pro-life or pro-choice moderators? Reddit has *specifically* avoided making that choice by allowing whoever creates it first to be the moderator over it (Within specific guidelines). If they were to remove the mod from /r/holocaust because it was anti-Semite and about holocaust denial, then they're opening themselves up to have to decide whether or not something like /r/abortion or /r/birthcontrol or /r/vaccineMyths or whatever subreddit you want should really be tailored to a different viewpoint, and honestly at that point we're diving into censorship territory.","score":18,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

But other people see the world differently and hold different truths. Our personal realities seem 100% genuine and true to us which is fine. But I also believe in an absolute truth that we will find out at some point whether in this life or after. But in regards to 'crossing a line', I think that will largely depend on societal trends and how a lot of issues are viewed. I think the movie Gattaca paints a somewhat realistic version of a possible future for humanity. A lot of people (myself included) would consider eugenics on that level as crossing a line, but what if you're a parent and a doctor comes to you and says that your child will have a seriously debilitating disease unless you alter some gene. I think the idea of 'crossing a line' paints a picture that is too black and white in relation to how society changes (I won't say 'evolves' because I'm not 100% sold that we're any 'better' as a species than we were 2000 years ago) Society will inevitably change.

Proving that consent was or was not given ahead of time, and not revoked at any point while awake is way harder, and would basically render the outcome of any trial entirely dependent on who has a better lawyer.\n\nEthically, however, when you consider the true state of mind of every participant rather than what can or cannot be proven - you should be able to do so. First, rape is bad because it violates the will of a person about what to do with their body, and does it in a traumatizing way. In case of an unconscious person, since unconscious people don't have a will in the same sense as conscious people do, we extrapolate the will from the last conscious state. If it didn't include the intention to have sex (like it can be the case of being subjected to rape drugs), then it's obviously rape. By applying the same standard of extrapolating the will from last conscious state, if the person wanted to participate in unconscious sex all the time while awake, then it shouldn't be rape. Second, people can already consent to all sorts of medical procedures under anesthesia. In some places, people can even consent to euthanasia for the case of their being in coma, and certain conditions about their organism are met. Generally, doing something to an unconscious person that they asked to do while awake is considered ethically acceptable, even in cases when doing so against their will would be considered very unacceptable. There doesn't seem to be a reason why sex is significantly different from these other cases. Thus, it has to be possible to consent ahead of time.","score":3,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

On the one hand humor can act as a catalyst for change or it can act as blockage.  On the other hand, a more face saving approach in which we consider the reasons the individual has arrived at their behavior in helping to \"jaunt them into taking other's needs seriously,\" can have similar issues yet perhaps even cut deeper emotionally.  Humor can soften the vulnerability of a mistake that a face saving or sensitive approach rips right open.\n\nUltimately these approaches have to be considered on a case by case scenario.  The considerations have to include considering you and your own personality, the person who is parroting misogyny, and the power dynamics between you, as well as the physical space you are in.\n\nA strategy that makes a lot of sense with a family member, doesn't work with a friend, doesn't work with a colleague or co-worker, and all of those likely don't work with internet strangers.  But in all cases I think a mixture of a face saving approach, a guarded approach, and a playful teasing approach can be used.\n\nMaybe I am being a little OT with this, it just feels strange to see people discussing the superiority of different tactics, when tactics exist in a real field that is dynamic and specific.","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

The oldest tradition is to use dyed and painted chicken eggs, but a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs, or plastic eggs filled with confectionery such as jelly beans. Eggs, in general, were a traditional symbol of fertility, and rebirth. In Christianity, for the celebration of Eastertide, Easter eggs symbolize the empty tomb of Jesus: though an egg appears to be like the stone of a tomb, a bird hatches from it with life; similarly, the Easter egg, for Christians, is a reminder that Jesus rose from the grave, and that those who believe will also experience eternal life.\n\n\n---\n\n[^(**Picture**)](http://i.imgur.com/hL0sbDY.jpg) ^- **^Easter ^eggs ^in ^a ^basket**\n\n[^(image source)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eastereggs_ostereier.jpg) ^| [^(about)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| *^(/u/TheGeorge can reply with 'delete'.

(And even if you built such a ship, any given person would still be in only a single state at a time)\n\nThe same impracticality would apply to the underground solution I think - Getting a person far enough underground that they could be said to have passed under all 50 states in less than six hours is probably beyond our current tech. (NOTE: I haven't done the math here and I'm just assuming the level you'd have to get the person to is somewhere in the Mantle or lower)\n\nYes, you could allow any answer no matter how impractical for this question, but at that point you may as well say you're inventing an aircraft that goes nearly the speed of light and that will automatically be the best answer, which is kinda boring.","score":6,"subreddit":"xkcd"}
