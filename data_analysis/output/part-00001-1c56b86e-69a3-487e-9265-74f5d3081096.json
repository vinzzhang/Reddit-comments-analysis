These include [endospores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endospores), [Akinetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akinete), and spores produced by [Actinobacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinobacteria) and *[Azotobacter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azotobacter)*. Spore formation in bacteria is not a method of reproduction but simply a method of surviving unfavourable conditions. They have a number of features:\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* They can tolerate extreme dryness.\n\n&gt;* Some cannot be killed even at subzero temperatures.\n\n&gt;* Some can spread poisonous chemicals, such as the Cry toxin synthesised by *[Bacillus thuringiensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_thuringiensis)*\n\n&gt;Bacterial spores are extremely resistant. Spores of [tetanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus) and [anthrax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax), for example, can survive in the soil for many years. The origin of these spores was discovered in the 19th century, when a biologist noticed, under the microscope, a small, round, bright body inside bacterial cells. This survived even when the bacteria were boiled for five minutes. This killed the bacteria, but not the spores. [They](http://www.slideshare.net/Ashraf05/bacterial-spores-ashraf-24915787) [germinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germination) when conditions were right. Because spores are so resistant, they are highly transmissible. This makes them a very problematic aspect of spore-forming pathogens such as [Clostridium difficile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile).\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Endospore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endospore) ^| [^Spore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore) ^| [^Bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria) ^| [^Anthrax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cli44uq) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cli44uq)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","score":10,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down. Bullets fired other than exactly vertical are more dangerous, as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory, is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion, and so travels at a speed much higher than its terminal velocity would be in a purely vertical fall.\n\n&gt;A study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that 80% of celebratory gunfire-related injuries are to the head, feet, and shoulders. In Puerto Rico, about two people die and about 25 more are injured each year from celebratory gunfire on New Year's Eve, the CDC says. Between the years 1985 and 1992, doctors at the King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, treated some 118 people for random falling-bullet injuries. Thirty-eight of them died. Kuwaitis celebrating in 1991 at the end of the Gulf War by firing weapons into the air caused 20 deaths from falling bullets.\n\n&gt;Firearms expert Julian Hatcher studied falling bullets in the 1920s and calculated that .30 caliber rounds reach terminal velocities of 300 feet per second (90 m/s). A bullet traveling at only 200 feet per second (61 m/s) to 330 feet per second (100 m/s) can penetrate human skin.\n\n&gt;In 2005, the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA) ran education camp ... \n`(Truncated at 1500 characters)`\n\n---\n\n[^(about)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| *^(/u/kevroy314 can reply with 'delete'.

{"author":"Kirsham","created_date":"2014-03-26 21:19:18","body":"Let's say you have a normally distributed population with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Let's say you were to pull a sample from this population. Because of random chance, you wouldn't always get a sample with a mean of 100. In fact, if you pulled many samples from the population, most of the sample means would not be 100, but you would get more samples close to 100 and less samples far away from 100. If you were to pull an infinite number of samples and plotted the means in each sample, you would find that the means would follow what is known as the t-distribution.\n\nNote, however, that pulling an infinite number of samples is obviously impossible. The t-distribution is a theoretical distribution, and is used to determine the probability that a sample was drawn from a population. \n\nHere's a made up example as a demonstration: Let's say you have tested the IQ of 100 professors, and their mean IQ was 135. The mean IQ in the overall population of humans is 100 (by definition). Now you ask yourself, do professors on average have a higher IQ than the overall population? To answer this, you estimate the probability that your data arose given that the opposite is true, namely that professors do not differ from the overall population in terms of IQ. Here's where the t-distribution comes into play. Remember when we pulled an infinite number of samples, and plotted them? Remember how most of the samples were close to 100? That means that if our sample is sufficiently far away from 100, we can say that it's unlikely that we obtained our sample mean by pure chance. In our example (mean of 100, standard deviation of 15), 95% of samples drawn would have an average IQ of between 70 and 130. This means that it's fairly unlikely (less than 5% chance) that our data, with its mean of 135, was drawn from the same population as the overall population. As a last note, this tells us nothing about what this means in terms of what we wanted to find out. That is subject to subsequent analysis.","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

{"author":"gschizas","created_date":"2014-02-02 14:11:53","body":"It is, yes :) I'm not sure your project really requires it though - it's quite simple.\n\nIn the spirit of improving your code and following [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), here are some more suggestions:\n\n1. Method names are supposed to be lower_case_with_underscores (aka snake_case), not CapitalizedWords (aka PascalCase/CamelCase) or even worse, mixedCase (this is only reserved for backwards compatibility).\n2. There is no reason for \"get\" - this is not Java :) Better use some more descriptive name, e.g. download_all() or download_random()\n3. Don't try to catch all exceptions, this is \n4. fetchJSON (or better yet, fetch_json or fetch_JSON, for PEP8 compliance, or something like comic_info_url to make a bit more sense) could be static - it doesn't use \"self\" at all. You could either make it a standalone function\n5. You don't need to do this: 'someformat{0}'.format(str(some_number)). Since you are using format, the \"str\" is useless - it's handled by the format function\n6. While on the case of format, you can also do this: 'someformat{}'.format(some_number), and will have the same result as 'someformat{0}'.format(some_number).\n7. Usage of magic numbers in code is frowned upon. Don't write \"0.083 * something\", make \"0.083\" into a constant and use that instead.\n8. os.makedirs has a parameter that effectively says \"don't worry if the path already exists\". So, instead of \"if not os.path.exists(self.download_dir): os.makedirs(self.download_dir)\", you can just write \"os.makedirs(self.download_dir, exist_ok=True)\"\n9. Also, instead of using print() to show debug messages, consider using the (quite nice) logging module - it allows you to redirect your logs to files (instead of the standard output), with just a few lines of configuration.\n10. Don't test paths for \"/\" - it doesn't work on Windows. Use os.path.sep instead.\n\nDon't take this the wrong way, this is a wonderful program that you made, and I'm stealing some of it for a personal project (I wanted to add a datestamp at picture taken from a security camera). I took a coursera class this autumn and it comes naturally to me.\n","score":6,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

It regulates the flow of water leaving the Mississippi into the [Atchafalaya River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atchafalaya_River), thereby preventing the Mississippi river from changing course. Completed in 1963, the complex was built by the [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Army_Corps_of_Engineers) in a side channel of the Mississippi known as \"Old River,\" between the Mississippi's current channel and the [Atchafalaya Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atchafalaya_Basin), a former channel of the Mississippi.      The Old River Control Structure is actually a complex containing the original low-sill and overbank structures, as well as the auxiliary structure that was constructed after the low-sill structure was damaged during the Mississippi River Flood of 1973. The complex also contains a navigation lock and the Sidney A.

Use concurrency, MVars, system calls, whatever you like. If you can write such a program I'll concede that Haskell has side-effects that can be seen within the program, but I don't think you (or anyone) can. :-)\n\nMy claim is that you cannot without using the unsafe* functions.

Margaret also confronts many other pre-teen female issues, such as buying her first [bra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassiere), having her [first period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menarche), coping with belted [sanitary napkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_napkin) (changed to adhesive sanitary pads for recent editions of the book), jealousy towards another girl who has developed a womanly figure earlier than other girls, liking boys, and whether to voice her opinion if it differs from those of her friends.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Are ^You ^There ^God? ^It's ^Me, ^Margaret.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_There_God%3F_It%27s_Me,_Margaret.) ^| [^Are ^You ^There ^God? ^It's ^Me, ^Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_There_God%3F_It%27s_Me,_Jesus) ^| [^Judy ^Blume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Blume) ^| [^Then ^Again, ^Maybe ^I ^Won't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Then_Again,_Maybe_I_Won%27t) ^| [^Are ^You ^There, ^Chelsea?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_There,_Chelsea%3F) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ckq1i5o) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+ckq1i5o)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

For example, one might count the number of ballots whereon the voter had crossed out the name of the [political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party) that nominated the candidate, even if (maybe only if) that voter had voted for him or her. This would indicate support for candidates but would be able to send signals to them that the \"party line\" was not why that voter voted for them, but rather, she or he expected them to act independently.\n\n&gt;Such marking and counting could be carried out on an ordinary ballot with no provision for it, however, there would be risk of counting it as \"spoiled\" if the marks were unclear, and if ballot design had not allowed for it initially.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Secret ^ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_ballot) ^| [^Ballot ^access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access) ^| [^Primary ^election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election) ^| [^Ballot ^\\(automobile)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_\\(automobile\\)) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ck1x7vm) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+ck1x7vm)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","score":4,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

If I'm not using a calculator, I personally would use Euler's theorem first to simplify the problem, then use successive squares. \n\nWe want 2014^2014 mod 100. Using Euler's theorem, We can simplify this by using \"phi\" of 100. Phi represents the number of relatively prime numbers less than 100. \n\nIt turns out the \"phi of 100\" is 40 (there are theorems that explain how to find phi of different numbers). \n\n* The exponent is 2014, and 2014 = 50*(phi of 100) + 14.\n\n\nUsing Euler's theorem, \n\n* 2014^2014 (mod 100) = (2014^(phi of 100))^50 * 2014^14 (mod 100) = 2014^14 (mod 100).\n\nSo now, all we have to do is find 2014^14 (mod 100), which is much simpler. To do this, we use the method of successive squares.\n\n\nIn 2014^14, the exponent is 14, 14 =  2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 = 8 + 4 + 2\n\n2014^1 mod 100 = 14\n\n2014^2 mod 100 = 14^2 = 96 \n\n2014^4 mod 100 = 96^2 = 16\n\n2014^8 mod 100 = 16^2 = 56 (remember, this is all in mod 100)\n\nSo,\n \n* 2014^14 = 2014^(8 + 4 +2) = 2014^8 * 2014^4 * 2014^2 = 56 * 16 * 96 (mod 100)\n\n56 * 16 * 96 = 16 mod 100.\n\n**The answer is 16**\n\nIf I had a calculator, I would use successive squares right away because I would not mind going up to 2^10.

However, these different enzymes share the need to stabilize an [enolate anion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enolate_anion) intermediate derived from an [acyl-CoA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acyl-CoA) substrate.

{"author":"DSMan195276","created_date":"2014-08-10 06:54:56","body":"&gt; You don't really understand the concept of rules, do you? They're completely fucking arbitrary. If you're so bound by rules then how about they just make \"Don't be a racist misogynistic piece of shit (hereafter referred to as RMPOS)\" to the rules? There you go! It's a precious fucking rule to whack off over.\n\n&gt; Rules mean nothing. \n\nI agree with you, they are for the most part completely arbitrary. That doesn't mean it's a good idea for Reddit to just apply Rules and random \"common sense\" anywhere and anywhy they want. They have rules so everybody gets treated the same, whether or not you're a holocaust denier or anybody else, and if you don't get treated the same you have a complete list of rules that you can point to and say \"Hey, you're not following the rules\". I don't think you understand anything about running a website as big as Reddit.\n\n&gt; Are you a child? Do you honestly think no conflict arises from disagreements over rules? Do you honestly think rules are always enforced correctly? Get a grip, dude.\n\nNo, and no I do not, and no I do not. But having written down rules allows you to do all of those things you mentioned. It's not hard to point and say \"This Reddit Admin did something not within the rules\" and that would be a legitimate complaint. The point is that when the rules are enforced correctly then people can't complain that they're being treated unfairly, and when they're not enforced correctly all you have to do is point at the rules and it's obvious. If you don't like what's in the rules then go ahead and talk to people and try to get new ones put in place. If they just start doing whatever they hell they want then there's no room to complain they're not following their rules and no way to argue when a Reddit Admin makes a mistake.\n\n&gt; I'm pretty sure most people would agree that an RMPOS running /r/holocaust[1] defies logic. \n\nThis one I honestly don't understand. Why is there any reason to say /r/holocaust can't be about holocaust denial? The name '/r/holocaust' is fairly generic, and even more so we have plenty of subreddits that exist that don't have perfect names (Ex. /r/trees). Perhaps it's a bit dumb but holocaust denial still has to do with the holocaust. I don't like it but it doesn't \"defy logic\", it was perfectly possible to happen. You just don't like it, but Reddit isn't run by you.\n\n&gt; Reddit (the company) likes to pretend to be \"hands off\" yet can, has, and will put the brakes on anything that manages to threaten them as a business.\n\nYes, because those things are usually illegal and will get all of Reddit taken down. There's a difference in scale here, the US government and other various entities don't care who's running /r/holocaust or what's in it, they *do* care that there's a subreddit called /r/jailbait that looks like it's a bunch of child-porn.","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}
{"author":"[deleted]","created_date":"2014-08-10 07:23:07","body":"&gt;They have rules so everybody gets treated the same\n\nMy point being, they do NOT treat everyone the same. Their \"rules\" are selectively enforced all the time.\n\n&gt;when the rules are enforced correctly\n\nBy which interpretation? Ask one person and /r/jailbait was well within the guidelines. Ask another and it shouldn't have been created in the first place. \n\n&gt;If they just start doing whatever they hell they want then there's no room to complain they're not following their rules and no way to argue when a Reddit Admin makes a mistake.\n\nAnd how about the instances where mods and/or admins use those apparently inviolable rules to enforce their own policies? This is the problem with rules. No matter how airtight you make them there will always be some asshole or another there to exploit every hole they can find. That is why simply pointing to the rules and saying \"follow those\" does not work. That is why relying on rules to sort things out does not work.\n\nHell, just take a look at the FIA and their regulations for Formula 1. They're the most lawyer-fueled millimeter-fondling set of regulations for damn near anything... and they're STILL open to interpretation.\n\n&gt;Perhaps it's a bit dumb but holocaust denial still has to do with the holocaust. I don't like it but it doesn't \"defy logic\", it was perfectly possible to happen.\n\nBeing pedantic gets you nowhere. If you want to argue semantics then screw off. You yourself say you don't like it. That would put you in the category with the majority that find it complete bullshit, thereby reinforcing my point that most people would find it to be complete bullshit. You're arguing word choice, not the merit of my argument, which means you're running out of legs to stand on.\n\n&gt;but Reddit isn't run by you.\n\nNo, it's supposedly \"run\" by the majority. The up/down vote system is supposed to be a way to aggregate content that a majority want to see or find informative. Yet for some reason reddit doesn't apply this to moderation.\n\nWhy not?\n\nWhen the majority of people can clearly see that the moderator has nothing to do with the sub and is only using their status to enforce their opinion, therefore stifling the concept of \"free speech\" (which doesn't exist on a private website but people like to pretend does), WHAT RECOURSE DO THE USERS HAVE?\n\nWell, you can wait until they forget to log in for a few months.\n\nOther than that you're screwed.\n\n&gt;Yes, because those things are usually illegal and will get all of Reddit taken down.\n\nHolocaust denial is illegal in many countries. Marijuana use is illegal in most of the US. There are MANY subreddits dedicated to activities that are illegal in one place or another that could just as easily threaten reddit's existence. Several of the subs that violentacrez ran did not involve illegal content, even if they were morally reprehensible.\n\nBut they haven't been featured on the nightly news, now have they?\n\nIt's an absolute double standard. The admins of this site could easily provide more moderator oversight. That they choose not to while simultaneously banning people like violentacrez is hypocritical. They'll received dozens, if not hundreds, of complaints about abusive moderators but point to the rules and say \"Well, he's not really breaking any of those.\" The moment someone outside of reddit turns on the heat they completely change their mind and find some reason (usually \"rigging\") to get rid of everything questionable.\n\nIt's hypocrisy, plain and simple.

The tagline *\"a metaphorical [fugue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue) on minds and machines in the spirit of [Lewis Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll)\"* was used by the publisher to describe the book. \n\n&gt;By exploring common themes in the lives and works of logician [Kurt Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del), artist [M. C. Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher) and composer [Johann Sebastian Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach), *GEB* expounds concepts fundamental to [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry), and intelligence. Through illustration and analysis, the book discusses how self-reference and formal rules allow systems to acquire meaning despite being made of \"meaningless\" elements. It also discusses what it means to communicate, how knowledge can be represented and stored, the methods and limitations of symbolic representation, and even the fundamental notion of \"meaning\" itself.\n\n&gt;In response to confusion over the book's theme, Hofstadter has emphasized that *GEB* is not about mathematics, art, and music but rather about how cognition and thinking emerge from well-hidden neurological mechanisms. In the book, he presents an analogy about how the individual [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurons) of the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain) coordinate to create a unified sense of a coherent mind by comparing it to the social organization displayed in a [colony of ants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony).  \n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/Wp12Ba5.jpg) [^(i)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GEBcover.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Douglas ^Hofstadter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter) ^| [^I ^Am ^a ^Strange ^Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Strange_Loop) ^| [^Gödel's ^incompleteness ^theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) ^| [^BlooP ^and ^FlooP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlooP_and_FlooP) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ck7t2z0) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+ck7t2z0)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","score":7,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

It is traditionally written with embossed paper. Braille-users can read computer screens and other electronic supports thanks to [refreshable braille displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refreshable_braille_display). They can write braille with the original [slate and stylus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_and_stylus) or type it on a [braille writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_writer), such as a portable [braille note-taker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_note-taker), or on a computer that prints with a [braille embosser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_embosser).\n\n&gt;Braille is named after its creator, Frenchman [Louis Braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Braille), who lost his eyesight due to a childhood accident. In 1824, at the age of 15, Braille developed his code for the [French alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_alphabet) as an improvement on [night writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_writing). He published his system, which subsequently included [musical notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_notation), in 1829.   The second revision, published in 1837, was the first [digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data) (binary) form of writing.\n\n&gt;Braille characters are small rectangular blocks called *cells* that contain tiny palpable bumps called *raised dots*. The number and arrangement of these dots distinguish one character from another. Since the various braille alphabets originated as [transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(linguistics\\)) codes of printed writing systems, the mappings (sets of character designations) vary from language to language. Furthermore, in [English Braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Braille) there are three levels of encoding: Grade 1, a letter-by-letter transcription used for basic literacy; Grade 2, an addition of abbreviations and contractions; and Grade 3, various non-standardized personal [shorthands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand).\n\n&gt;Braille cells are not the only thing to appear in embossed text. There may be embossed illustrations and graphs, with the lines either solid or made of series of dots, arrows, bullets that are larger than braille dots, etc.\n\n&gt;In the face of [screen-reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) software, braille usage has declined. However, braille education remains important for [developing reading skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_read) among blind and visually impaired children, and [braille literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_literacy) correlates with higher employment rates.\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/DplcgRB.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Braille_closeup.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Ghanaian ^braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghanaian_braille) ^| [^Iñupiaq ^Braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C3%B1upiaq_Braille) ^| [^Philippine ^Braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Braille) ^| [^South ^African ^braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_braille) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cmv27xm) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cmv27xm)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","score":6,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

{"author":"XXCoreIII","created_date":"2014-10-09 14:48:28","body":"When this first started, activists were worried that national victories would result in a US constitutional amendment (which in turn would be practically unrepealable because it would only take 17 states to block the repeal, hello ex slave states). The fight was contained to the state level, either that existing laws didn't specify man and woman, or getting the laws changed. All the stuff up until that last climb is on this level. When the public mindset changed in responses to these acts, cases based on the US constitution sprung up.\n\nNext up is the screwy way our appeals system is set up. At the first level, it applies to the state. At another level, it applies to a group of states, for SCOTUS, it applies to the whole country. (there's also a court below SCOTUS that can rule nationwide but has no jurisdiction here). it's also considered an abuse of power for SCOTUS to hear a case in order to make it nationwide if all lower courts agree and they find themselves unlikely to disagree. Since at present no appeals court has found in favor of the state (plus some SCOTUS internal politicking over what constitutes overreach, see the Scalia dissent of the DOMA case), SCOTUS turned the cases currently on appeal down. national decision will be made district by district from here, or even state by state if the states decide to chicken out and not appeal to save their neighbor states, until a judge actually rules in favor of a state, and makes a SCOTUS hearing necessary.","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}
