Abbreviations for \"regular expression\" include \"regex\" and \"regexp\". The concept of regular expressions was first popularized by utilities provided by Unix distributions, in particular the editor ed and the filter grep. A regular expression is written in a formal language that can be interpreted by a regular expression processor, which is a program that either serves as a parser generator or examines text and identifies parts that match the provided specification. Historically, the concept of regular expressions is associated with Kleene's formalism of regular sets, introduced in the 1950s.\n\n---\n\n^| [^About](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| *^This ^bot ^automatically ^deletes ^its ^comments ^with ^karma ^of ^-1 ^or ^less.* ^| *[^(&amp;#9873; for deletion)](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/autowikibot&amp;subject=Just%20hit%20send%20:%29%20&amp;message=Parent%20comment:%20http://www.reddit.com/r/xkcd/comments/1uilzx/regex_golf/ceihcpi) ^if ^&gt;2 ^days ^old ^with ^karma ^&lt;0.*","score":10,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

{"author":"_ayli_","created_date":"2014-03-05 20:24:18","body":"Because I was bored...\n\nFrom http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Columbiformes_by_population, counting species that number 1mil+, we get an estimated total population of somewhere in the 500-600mil range. http://www.ask.com/question/how-many-pigeons-are-there-in-the-world gives an estimate of 400mil, so let's go with 500mil. Wikipedia gives the rock pigeon weight as around 11oz. Taking them as the average pigeon, this gives an estimated pigeon biomass of about 140000 metric tons. So pigeons don't rate even a single box on the chart (you'd need about 7-8x the number of pigeons to get one box).\n\nGetting population numbers for rats is more difficult. I found http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090915125805AAJmXEN, which estimates 1 rat per 36 people in NYC in 1949, and http://www.mphonline.org/most-rat-infested-cities-in-the-western-world/ which says NYC is most infested (but sadly does not give numbers). If we go with that, and Wikipedia's figure of about 200g per black rat, that gives us a global estimate of about 40 metric tons, which also doesn't rate even a single box.\n\nBonus:\n\nVarious sources put the number of cats at up to a billion. This is consistent with the US population and number of cat pets. The actual number could be higher if the rest of the world has a higher per-capita feral cat population. Assuming a billion cats and 10lbs per cat, this gives us a total cat biomass of 4.5 million tons - this definitely warrants at least four boxes, and I'm surprised cats aren't featured on the comic!","score":6,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

The only one I see that's arguably *based* on being anti-PUA is /r/TheBluePill. I'm considering being based on being anti-PUA, and being anti-PUA as a coincidence of the subreddit two different things; based on being anti-PUA would mean that the sub's main subject matter is talking about how terrible PUAs are. Let me do a rundown of x-posts I found by [searching this comic's URL](http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fxkcd.com%2F1325%2F):\n\n* /r/TwoXCromosomes: subject matter is just being a woman, and most subscribers are (supposedly) women. They'll be anti-PUA because... well... I'm just gonna say if you find a group of women (or... probably any sufficiently large group of people) and ask them \"what do you think about pick up artists\" they'll say that PUAs are pigs and awful people. Anti-PUA, but not anti-PUA based.\n\n* /r/Feminism: I don't need to explain this do I? Of course they're anti-PUA but the sub wasn't started to fight PUAs. Anti-PUA, but not anti-PUA based.\n\n* /r/AgainstMensRights: Not based on being anti-PUA, but based on being anti /r/MensRights... whose members seem to have a tendency towards pro-PUA. Anti-PUA, but not anti-PUA based.\n\n* /r/TrollXCromosomes: See /r/TwoXCromosomes.\n\n* /r/GeekFeminists: see /r/Feminism. \n\n* /r/SRSFunny and /r/SRSComics: If you're unfamiliar with the SRS Fempire, they exist to point out the various displays of isms on reddit. They behave like Tumblr SJWs, but whether or not they hold the views they preach is never quite so easy to say for sure. Anyway, misogyny is they're big one, and I think that if PUAs want to refer to women as HB(1-10) (e.g. HB8 means \"girl who's an 8 out of 10\"), I think that the Fempire is gonna take issue. Anti-PUA, but not anti-PUA based\n\n* /r/MensRights: I guess this could be pro-PUA? It shouldn't be but I've heard that there is a fair amount of pro-PUA sentiment there. I'll call them neutral. \n\n* /r/TheRedPill: Alright, there's the pro-PUA one.\n\nAnd the rest pretty much go on to be PUA neutral, or anti-PUA but not based on being anti-PUA. \n\nSo, I see 8 maybe 9 you can call anti-PUA, one you can call based on being anti-PUA, and one you can call pro-PUA.\n\nTL;DR: Word choice matters, and Adderall is one helluva drug. There are quite a lot of subs that are anti-PUA, but beyond /r/TheBluePill I don't know of any that focus entirely on being anti-PUA.","score":15,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

If you took a regular xkcd comic, and manipulated it (i.e. cropping) or used one part of it in your work (i.e. quoting the dialogue), that output would still be subject to the same license.\n\nThe work “Lorenz” is an interactive comic, and the font is a part of that work. If you take the font and make something with it, you still agree to the same license. Now, the author could theoretically use the font in more than one work/web page in a way that would somehow invalidate the licensing.

At another the focus is different: the first focuses on an absolute that you keep, the latter focuses on a difference between what you *would* spend and what you *do* spend.\n\nA standard way to prove different meanings of words is to show that they lead to different truth values in some context. The phrase \"the more you spend the more you save\" is an example of where the two subtly different meanings lead to different truth values: it's false that the more you spend, the more you have absolute money that you keep; it's true that the more you spend, the more you have a difference between what you would pay and what you do pay.\n\nSo if there are actually two words \"save\", Randall's argument becomes an equivocation fallacy: the ads make the claim with the second, relative sense and he argues against it based on the first, absolute sense.","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Elements are divided into [metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal), [metalloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloid), and [nonmetals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonmetal).\n\n&gt;The lightest chemical elements, including [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen), [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium) and smaller amounts of [lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium), [beryllium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium) and [boron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron), are thought to have been produced by various cosmic processes during the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) and [cosmic-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray) [spallation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spallation). Production of heavier elements, from carbon to the very heaviest elements, proceeded by [stellar nucleosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis), and these were made available for later [solar system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System) and planetary formation by [planetary nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula) and [supernovae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova), which blast these elements into space.  The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars.\n\n&gt;The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive [human societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society) that found [native elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_metal) like copper and gold and extracted ([smelted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting)) [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron) and a few other metals from their [ores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore). [Alchemists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy) and [chemists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry) subsequently identified many more, with nearly all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900. The properties of the chemical elements are often summarized using the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table), which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows ([\"periods\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(periodic_table\\))) in which the columns ([\"groups\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(periodic_table\\))) share recurring (\"periodic\") physical and chemical properties.

There are different languages for different situations/jobs. There are jobs where you have to use very precise language, where language is the tool - with the law for instance. The funny thing is that when learning the law it is almost as if you need to learn a new language - and in certain countries you even have to learn a new language because part of the law is written in that other language (Indonesia had Dutch law books for a while). Programming and theology also come to mind.\n\nSo if that is the case, and if we can also assume that certain 'deviant' forms of language are understood by all in our daily lives - why do we care about those mistakes?\n\nI could go on about the natural changes that any language goes through. There are even patterns in it.\n\nEvery language is a code where meaning is generated in the head of the receiver based on the context you are in - and depending on the context there is a different level of fault tolerance. Daily live: high fault tolerance, law: zero fault tolerance, pillow talk: every grunt you make and every laugh can have a different meaning that can only be understood by your lover. \n\nIn the context of this forum you have to realize that  different generations and different social groups are active. These social groups want to be able to recognize each other. Americans always use 'we' and 'our president' - and I can tell you that I am not part of that 'we' and I do not have a president. I read somewhere that in certain circles using a dot at the end of a sentence changes the meaning of the sentence. It is a code and you have to know the code.\n\nCertain other groups might use the mixing of their/they're/there as an equivalent of flipping people like you the bird and as a way to recognize each other. \n\nHave a nice stroll through the linguist subs here on reddit and maybe you could try talk about your problem. My experience is that they are very, very relaxed about such 'mistakes.' In their book, it is probably only very, very interesting.\n\nEDIT: You know what? I have been on reddit for more than 7 years, and if I now get downvoted for a comment like this - even on XKCD - you can all suck my stinking dick. This place has turned into a shithole.

A Student's t-distribution, or simply a t-distribution, is a probability distribution commonly used in statistics. Imagine you have a population with a mean and a standard deviation, which is roughly normally distributed. If you were to pull an infinite number of samples from this population and graph the means of each sample, you would get a t-distribution, and it would look like the distribution labeled \"Student's t-distribution\" in the comic.\n\nThe Student's t-distribrution is called such because when it was introduced in English literature, it was published under the pseudonym \"Student\", and hence is known as the Student's t-distribution. There's no such thing as a Teacher's t-distribution, however, the joke in the comic is that the first t-distribution is a t-distribution of the population \"students\", while the second is the t-distribution for the population \"teachers\". The latter population would presumably be much smaller than the first, and as such you would get a much more irregular t-distribution of that population than of the student population.","score":27,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Facebook actually got some really [good face verification results using deep nets](https://www.facebook.com/publications/546316888800776/).\n\nThe nice part about CNNs is that they allows us to jointly optimize the feature extractor and classifier. Most computer vision methods from the 90s and early 2000s relied on handcrafted feature extractors like LBP or SIFT, which were suboptimal. Instead of using the pixels as input to the model, these methods turned the image into a vector representation which was supposed to be scale, rotation and illumination invariant, but they weren't really optimized to extract the most discriminative features in the image. With CNN's the inputs are pixels and the convolutional filters which extract the features are learned using training data so they end up doing a better job selecting the features in the image that really help to distinguish what differs between the classes ([You can check out a good example of this at the 4:48 mark in this video](http://vk.com/video-44016343_166868324)). They're a hierarchical model so there are multiple layers of representation learned in the process, going from simple edge detectors all the way up to parts of objects.\n\nI'd say that they already are the de facto standard. They are practical right now and if Moore's Law keep up for the next few years we'll start seeing them beating humans in most recognition tasks.
