{"author":"bonoboTP","created_date":"2014-11-23 17:41:15","body":"This leads me to think that it's better to use pseudonyms on the internet instead of always putting your real identity out there. There are some very determined harassing and bullying people online and I've seen some very nasty cases (rather famous ones). It can involve stalking and spreading rumors, trying to intentionally harm one's credibility for the \"fun\" of it (some people are really weird).\n\nI also started to think about what I would do if really many people knew me. There will always be plenty of extremes on the negative side and maybe the positive people just don't interact with you as much so the net result looks more negative to you than it really is.\n\nTaking this to an extreme, what if millions of people know you (e.g. politicians, musicians...). How can you assess your reputation then? How can you have an outside objective point of view about yourself and whether your approach is working? If you filter people based on their opinions, you will still have hundreds of thousands of people who \"by filtering\" agree with anything you say in particular. So you can't just filter like that. Probably any filter is good that is uncorrelated to the sentiment of the opinion. It may be based on physical proximity, random choice, whatever. I wonder if high-profile politicians (like prime ministers or presidents) have a solution to this. Basically anyone they meet knows who they are and may have a hidden agenda (bias on the positive side to get a promotion or corruption money; or bias on the negative by trying to bring you down). Probably this is why they tend to put family and trusted old friends to high positions (besides the obvious corrupt politician trope).\n\nBut I guess you already thought much more about this, given your extensive posts on LessWrong about statistical biases and \"thinkos\".","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

I don't think it would be terribly hard, but probably time consuming.\n\nI'm going to assume you already know how to make a webpart. So, you'd probably have to cache the comic image and possibly the link to the original source. And by caching, that could either be creating a service that downloads the new comic on a daily basis and perhaps loads it to a picture library or something (loading it on the fly from xkcd's site wouldn't be good for anyone).\n\nNot sure how you would introduce the interactive comics though. I suppose you could always load it up in an iframe, but any kind of dynamic loading like that would weigh on the page load (although you could make it asynchronous, again though, if it's on a home page, there's probably other dynamic content loading, so that's just one more thing on the DOM to load).\n\nEDIT: found some more info.... looks like you can can make an ajax call and get json data back about the current comic (from the about page):\n\n&gt;Is there an interface for automated systems to access comics and metadata?\n\n&gt; Yes. You can get comics through the JSON interface, at URLs like http://xkcd.com/info.0.json (current comic) and http://xkcd.com/614/info.0.json (comic #614).\n\nThat would make writing the service a lot easier.

Actually possessing the operational features, such as 'full-auto', changes the classification from assault weapons to [Title II weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_II_weapons). The mere possession of cosmetic features was enough to warrant classification as an assault weapon. Semi-automatic firearms, when fired, automatically extract the spent cartridge casing and load the next cartridge into the chamber, ready to fire again. They do not fire automatically like a machine gun. Rather, only one round is fired with each trigger pull.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Assault ^weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon) ^| [^Violent ^Crime ^Control ^and ^Law ^Enforcement ^Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act) ^| [^Assault ^weapons ^legislation ^in ^the ^United ^States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapons_legislation_in_the_United_States) ^| [^Dianne ^Feinstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianne_Feinstein) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cl3lrjz) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cl3lrjz)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","score":6,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

This leads to the famous \"pressing lightsabers against each other\" scenes during duels.\n\nIn addition, since blasters fire plasma in a magnetic field (disclaimer: I have no idea how \"firing\" a magnetic field works), the blasts aren't infinite, do not move at the speed of light, and can be deflected by anything else using a magnetic field (such as lightsabers).","score":25,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

As such it's gender-neutral.  Now, it may seem gendered because the assumption in US society (and others) is that women are asked out by men.  This means men are the ones who bring it up the most - it's most relevant to them.  If the roles were reversed (or ideally, if there was no assumption on who was asking out whom) the term would almost certainly seem less gendered.\n\nUnrequited love is a frustration all genders share, and all of them can have good and bad reactions to it.  But humor can end up submitting to trends, and that's what happened here - the trend of calling out so-called nice guys made it into the comic.

Though she was sure he’d had enough, Randall asked for more, and continued to feed until Megan had no milk left to give him.\n\nThe weird thing is, besides all the batshit, it's actually quite well written*.

IO is done in the same way with the similar IO monad, which has actual true effects. The main function is in the IO monad.\n\nLazy means that a function is only evaluated when the result is needed.

I don't stay pen-pals or anything, and typically don't reply to theirs unless they have questions in return (very rare). It's never just 'thanks -B' or something, it's usually 'Thanks for the kind words. It's important to keep learning and developing and yada yada...' and 'Thanks again, -...'. \n\nThere's no real 'personal' way to say thank you, other than a gift or something. I feel like if I were to get a gift from someone just for thanking *them* or asking a question, that'd be a little weird. I did feel a little emboldened recently by Auerbach, whom I mentioned earlier, albeit it was a kind of ironic emboldening. I was thanking him for approaching the '4chan/troll' situation as a true moderate - he didn't condemn the 4chan user base, but rather said '*if* you're going to condemn someone, and I'm not sure we should yet, then condemn the guy who owns the site.' Really, [that article](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/09/the_fappening_ebola_chan_revenge_porn_why_isn_t_4chan_s_founder_accountable.html) cuts straight through the troll bullshit. I'd recommend it. \n\nAnyway, I explained why the article stuck out to me and what I got from it, and it was like I said, a brilliant maneuvering through a troll-mine-field. It's bold to call out 4chan as a columnist like that, and he did it flawlessly. In his reply he said:\n\n&gt;..thanks for reassuring me that my point didn't get completely lost in the noise. I hope the reasonable people can win out.\n\nAnd that made me feel good. You know those times when you see a guy on TV or something and think, 'I bet he and I would get along well'? That's how I felt about Auerbach when I clicked 'send'. So his reply was kinda neat in that regard. ","score":7,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

I had forgotten what it was called, but they're what I was referring to in the original post.\n\nIndeed, latency issues were basically its downfall. I realize that what I'm thinking isn't feasible in the near future, but 5-10 years down the line it's totally achievable. Look at how 4G networks are being implemented worldwide and the 5G advancements being made in Asia. \n\nWhat I'm envisioning (and again, I'm not a visionary by far. I'm just a guy who loves computers but has no connection to the IT field whatsoever.) is more of an OS which is cloud-integrated.\n\nYour devices basically receive a \"remote connection\" to a virtual machine which runs everything (processing power, graphics, apps etc.) and delivers the graphical output to your device. Think of it as portable monitors/screens that connect to the same computer. Once wireless Internet connections become fast and reliable enough (which is soon to be a reality) it will be the most practical way to do things.\n\nI think it's kind of cumbersome to carry so many independent computers around. I usually carry my smartphone, my tablet and laptop computer to work every day. At home I have other independent devices (e-readers, smart TV, gaming consoles etc.) It's cumbersome to save something on your laptop and then working with a cloud-based storage solution to access it from my tablet. It's weird to have different apps on my Android devices when it's possible to have a way of an OS knowing what apps you have installed on your other devices and synchronize between them.\n\nWith my idea, you basically have one single computer with everything on it and you access it from multiple devices. It's all the same OS, it's all the same apps, everything is in one place (the virtual machine) and on all devices at once. No need to sync between devices, no need to move or share files for yourself. You have one computer with multiple displays. Ones you keep on you while on the go. Others to keep at home. You will basically have to purchase something like a \"performance plan\" where you get a subscription for processor power, memory, graphic capabilities of the central (virtual) machine, and then just stream whatever it does to your devices. Thus, your devices will require minimum processing power, meaning that they require less power and less updates all while performing as good as the virtual machine they connect to.\n\nI don't know if I'm explaining right, but I haven't heard of anyone planning for something similar as of yet.","score":0,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

If that includes intelligence that could be considered sentient, all the better, should be really cool, but those machines will still be programmed to do xyz tasks.\n\nYou're assuming in your thoughts that robots would form in the way that humans did: randomly. What we perceive as a desire to be \"happy\", is actually a bunch of different chemical reactions that have evolved from survival instincts. Robots and machines have always been designed as \"technology\": tools to make life easier for humans. Who's to say a sentient robot wouldn't only desire to serve humans?\n\nThe only way we would have the issue you are talking about is if there is some code that either evolves from code (for bots that write their own code) that was used earlier (for example, a coder trying to make the robots more friendly or something might give a code-writing bot a desire to be more human, and over a few updates might become actual human-like sentience) or some code placed into a central machine's code maliciously.\n\nAnother thing that will have to be considered is that human \"code\" is rewritten very rarely. This means that we evolve very slowly, whereas machines evolve much faster.

However, this solution has foreknowledge of the password, and includes the elements needed to find it in its ridiculously short word list (there's over a million words in English alone - that's assuming you're not using words from other languages, as non-English speakers are prone to do) which artificially inflates the success probability of a complete match (to 100%) and decreases the time requirements (by only requiring combinations across just over 2000 words).\n\nIt also relies on the principal of universal commonality - that in my efforts to generate a unique password, I will use words that are common to English language speakers as a whole, rather than obscure terms that may not be in the dictionary at all, or are 'wrong' words that nonetheless make perfect sense in the context of the original comic (e.g. GaldalfLurvesSavingWickedHobbitses) AND, even though it wasn't explicitly stated in the comic, adding a single substitution or addition will break even the most thorough standard dictionary attack.\n\nIt's not an infallible system by any means, but to standard character-driven brute force attempts and even most real-world dictionary attacks, it's relatively robust, especially when personalized terminology is used.

{"author":"TexasJefferson","created_date":"2014-11-21 19:26:37","body":"\"Timeless decision theory\" The idea is that, given a lot of constraints, it's possible for two sufficiently rational agents, with sufficient knowledge of one another, to cooperate in spite of not being able to causally effect one another (for instance, if they exist at different times or very far away from each other). The (argued) viability of acausal trade is an unintuitive idea and not a part of current mainstream decision theory.\n\nHere's LW's wiki's example:\n\n&gt;In Newcomb's problem, a superintelligent artificial intelligence, Omega, presents you with a transparent box and an opaque box. The transparent box contains $1000 while the opaque box contains either $1,000,000 or nothing. You are given the choice to either take both boxes (called two-boxing) or just the opaque box (one-boxing). However, things are complicated by the fact that Omega is an almost perfect predictor of human behavior and has filled the opaque box as follows: if Omega predicted that you would one-box, it filled the box with $1,000,000 whereas if Omega predicted that you would two-box it filled it with nothing.\n\n&gt;Many people find it intuitive that it is rational to two-box in this case. As the opaque box is already filled, you cannot influence its contents with your decision so you may as well take both boxes and gain the extra $1000 from the transparent box. CDT formalizes this style of reasoning. However, one-boxers win in this scenario. After all, if you one-box then Omega (almost certainly) predicted that you would do so and hence filled the opaque box with $1,000,000. So you will almost certainly end up with $1,000,000 if you one-box. On the other hand, if you two-box, Omega (almost certainly) predicted this and so left the opaque box empty . So you will almost certainly end up with $1000 (from the transparent box) if you two-box. Consequently, if rationality is about winning then it's rational to one-box in Newcomb's problem (and hence CDT fails to be an adequate decision theory).\n\n&gt;TDT will endorse one-boxing in this scenario and hence endorses the winning decision. When Omega predicts your behavior, it carries out the same abstract computation as you do when you decide whether to one-box or two-box. To make this point clear, we can imagine that Omega makes this prediction by creating a simulation of you and observing its behavior in Newcomb's problem. This simulation will clearly decide according to the same abstract computation as you do as both you and it decide in the same manner. Now given that TDT says to act as if deciding the output of this computation, it tells you to act as if your decision to one-box can determine the behavior of the simulation (or, more generally, Omega's prediction) and hence the filling of the boxes. So TDT correctly endorses one-boxing in Newcomb's problem as it tells the agent to act as if doing so will lead them to get $1,000,000 instead of $1,000.","score":5,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Or else.\n\n&gt; Earth collapses politically and economically in the wake of this population crash; the Internet Engineering Task Force eventually assumes the mantle of the United Nations, or at least its altruistic mission and charitable functions. Anarchism replaces nation-states; in the novel the UN is described as having 900 of the planet's 15,000 polities as members, and its membership is not limited to polities.\n\n&gt; A century later, the first interstellar missions, using quantum tunnelling-based jump drives to provide effective faster-than-light travel without violating causality, are launched. One that reaches Barnard's Star finds what happened to those who disappeared from Earth: they were sent to colonise other planets via wormholes that took them back one year in time for every light-year (ly) the star was from Earth. Gradually, it is learned, these colonies were scattered across a 6,000-ly area of the galaxy, all with the same message from the Eschaton etched onto a prominent monument somewhere. There is also evidence that the Eschaton has enforced the \"or else\" through drastic measures, such as inducing supernovae or impact events on the civilization that attempted to create causality-violating technology.\n\nVery little deals with Eschaton itself... though it touches on it at times.  Eschaton doesn't like making direct actions and instead acts through other agents when possible.","score":3,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

{"author":"13x666","created_date":"2014-08-27 07:19:48","body":"Today we've published our [Russian adaptation of 1412](http://xkcd.ru/1412/), and I decided to share the final result along with the story of how we made it.\n\nOur team has been working at the [xkcd.ru](http://xkcd.ru/) project for almost a year now (there were other guys before us), and we've translated and adapted a ton of strips (including [really](http://xkcd.ru/xkcd_img/1331/), [tough](http://xkcd.ru/1256/), [ones](http://xkcd.ru/1052/)). When we saw 1412, we were pretty excited.\n\nThis one wasn't too tough actually. It took us mere two days (those other examples took *much* longer). But it was one of the most fun to do translations/adaptations ever.\n\nImmediately after seeing the strip two of us independently downloaded a list of all Russian wikipedia article titles, a 73 MB file. I went on and wrote a quick script to filter out titles with incorrect number of syllables, and that left me with just 5 MB: around 140,000 candidates. Further filtering the list to only contain at least 4 words yielded 10,000 titles most of which were unsuitable: they had a wrong stress pattern and/or were names, toponyms or boring stuff like that. So there still was a task of finding the right ones by hand on both regular and 4-word lists. Other team members used other tricks or simply got lost in Wikipedia, following random links and hoping to find a \"turtle-article\" (surprisingly, that worked really well).\n\nWe then created a Google Docs document and spent several hours filling it with \"turtle-titles\", continuously laughing. The damned TMNT song got stuck in our heads, and right now it doesn't look like it's going anywhere, at least from mine (listening to 'The Purple People Eater' and 'Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini' does not help at all). We spoke the Turtle language along the way—a language where every phrase had \"the right syllable stress pattern\". You know, that's the kind of syndrome you can get by [playing too much 2048](http://xkcd.com/1344/)... Anyway, we ended up with around 200 ridiculously great titles, now we had to narrow it down to 60 and choose 6 of those to be TMNT logos...\n\nSo yeah, we did that too. Throwing all the good stuff away was painful, but we did it. On the other hand, imitating Randall's style in TMNT logos was a fun task.\n\nThere is a fundamental problem: Russian words are longer on average and have more syllables than English words, so following the pattern of the original, \"*at least four words ending in a noun*\", was simply impossible. Most of our titles are adjective-noun combos, but we do have our gems.\n\nSo these are the titles we ended up using for the TMNT logos:\n\n* [BLONDE GIRL jokes](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Анекдоты_о_блондинках) (Russian only) — yeah, ru.wiki has an article for that, complete with a photo of pink keyboard, but actually lacking a photo of a blonde girl...\n* [Snow White and the Seven DWARVES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs)\n* [MUHTAR's return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhtar%27s_return) — this is a Russian series about a dog detective. Not like a \"pet detective\", it's a dog who *is* a detective... but still close, right? :D\n* [BrainSTORMING method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming)\n* [Equality of men and WOMEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality) — some of those women ought to be science fiction authors.\n* [List of craters on VENUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_craters_on_Venus)\n\nAnd here's a few from the remaining 54, in random order:\n\n* Should a Hedgehog Have Spikes?\n* Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers\n* Toilet paper\n* Exclusive OR\n* Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson\n* How I Met Your Mother\n* Pornography in Russia\n* Right turn on red\n* Floating point numbers\n* Existential crisis\n* Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc\n* ...\n\nOverall, I think we've had about as much fun with this piece as Randall did, if not more, and the result makes us happy. I hope you enjoyed this little making-of. :)","score":6,"subreddit":"xkcd"}
