Maybe localized to the abutting/contacting glia. Channels open and close that allow sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sometimes chloride ions to cross the membranes along the electro-chemical gradients that have been established by active ion pumps. Each cells is constantly resetting the transmembrane electrochemical potential. The movement of electrical charge over space is a bit of a misnomer. It's adjacent voltage gated channels opening and then closing with a bit of a refractory period that allows for coherent waves of depolarization to \"flow\" along neuronal cell bodies.\n\nThe whole neurons as wires concept needs to be dropped. They're more transducers and small computational units. Chemical input -&gt; integration at soma-&gt; action potentials that vary in frequency and amplitutde -&gt; chemical release at synapse. This is combined with alterations in cellular homeostasis in each neuron and the surrounding glia that may include regulation at the level of protein localization, expression, gene regulation and even long term epigenetic changes.\n\n","score":4,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Al Gore, for example, was born in Washington, D.C. (Though he served as vice-president rather than president, the requirement is identical.) There are those who question whether a person must be born in a *State* to qualify. (If Al Gore would not qualify, then does John McCain, who was born in an overseas territory?

Unless you launch the golf balls fast enough to escape the gravity of the bag of golf balls, you aren't doing anything.\n\nFor example, with a bag of golf balls 100 billion miles across, escape velocity would be about 250c. It can't be done (hence why he mentioned the bag of golf balls would form a black hole). For a bag the size of the distance from the Sun to Mars, escape velocity would be around 3 million miles per hour. So Tiger Woods, too, couldn't send a 200kg spaceship from Earth orbit to the Moon by hitting golf balls off it. With a bag the size of the Earth, escape velocity is \"only\" 14k miles per hour. Still too fast.\n\nHis potato cannon example is actually getting close to break-even. Escape velocity is about 250 miles an hour, and they are ejected at 310 miles an hour, so at least we actually get *some* momentum from the hit; we can move the spaceship. \n\nExcept we still aren't going to get to the moon, because the ultimate exhaust velocity of 60 mph means we are only being pushed 1/5 as hard as we expected without worrying about gravity. We'd need a bigger bag of golf balls to have enough \"fuel,\" which increases gravity and... well, you get the idea. The 310-mph potato cannon isn't gonna get us there either.\n\nBut if you can get a little more kick, you can make it work. Somewhere around 370-380mph I think.","score":11,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

That's close enough to the 9096 OP had in his post.\n\nNow on to the distance. There are several entries with a distance of 10000000, according to the explanation this means missing or conflicting data. So we throw these out, too. Leaves us with 8851 stars with an **average distance of 443.0286252 parsecs or roughly 1445 light years** (sum of distance divided by number of stars) and a **median of 255.1020408 parsecs or roughly 832 light years** (one half of the stars are closer and the other half farther away than this).\n\n**tl;dr:** The light from the stars visible to the naked eye was emitted on average around the [year 569](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/569).\n\n*Edited for consistent use of the decimal point instead of comma.*","score":47,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

If we imagine the light confined to a two-dimensional plane, the light from the flash spreads out in a circle after the event E occurs, and if we graph the growing circle with the vertical axis of the graph representing time, the result is a [cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry\\)), known as the future light cone. The past light cone behaves like the future light cone in reverse, a circle which contracts in radius at the speed of light until it converges to a point at the exact position and time of the event E. In reality, there are three space [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(vector_space\\)), so the light would actually form an expanding or contracting sphere in 3D space rather than a circle in 2D, and the light cone would actually be a [four-dimensional version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercone) of a cone whose cross-sections form 3D spheres (analogous to a normal three-dimensional cone whose cross-sections form 2D circles), but the concept is easier to visualize with the number of spatial dimensions reduced from three to two.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/lxfzjlf.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:World_line.svg) - *Light cone in 2D space plus a time dimension.*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Light-cone ^coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-cone_coordinates) ^| [^Light ^cone ^gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone_gauge) ^| [^Causal ^contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_contact) ^| [^String ^field ^theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_field_theory) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cm80qpk) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cm80qpk)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

This basically trains you to begin to think like a computer. To facilitate this, you have to learn various stuff, mostly at an introductory level, e.g. how to read from file, how to write to file, how to store data in memory, how to do a roundhouse kick, etc.\n\nThat may sound grand but it's actually quite boring. You can find all sorts of practice problems all over the web (http://codingbat.com/, /r/dailyprogrammer, etc.)\n\n---\n\nFor example: (source: http://codingbat.com/prob/p178728)\n\n&gt; Given 2 ints, a and b, return their sum. However, \"teen\" values in the range 13..19 inclusive, are extra lucky. So if either value is a teen, just return 19. \n\n&gt; teenSum(3, 4) → 7\n\n&gt; teenSum(10, 13) → 19\n\n&gt;teenSum(13, 2) → 19\n\n---\n\nA lot of the exercises in this period seem pointlessly... pointless, and textbooks try to remedy that to an extent; some succeed and some fail. That's not the point. The point is to learn to turn what you want to get done into something a machine can understand and carry out. This is a basic skill; acquire it and move on.\n\nThe bad thing about learning this skill without getting credit for it is that it'll be repeated in the first quarter in college.

The shift particle cannot be detected directly, but its properties can be inferred from differences in the kerning force between 'simple' atoms and their subatomic homochars.  No element has more than one shift particle.  As shift particles cannot be detected, their existence was for a long time a question of great controversy.  However, as the messages exchanged in the debate became more heated, statistical anomalies in the frequency of appearance of 'simple' atoms were eventually proven to be the result of an uneven distribution of shift particles.  A controversial alternate theory, that of the CAPS field, still has a few adherents.\n\nWhen sufficient energy is imparted to a 'Ni' atom, it will break into the shift particle, as well as the subatomic 'n' and 'i' particles.  Except under the most extreme conditions, the shift particle will invariably join with one of the two particles to form the element 'N' or the element 'I'.  The other particle will usually join with a free shift particle shortly thereafter;  however, more complex atomic interactions are possible.  For instance, Nickel-Aluminum cross-fusion was discovered quite early by nuclear physicists, yielding Lithium and Sodium:   ' Ni + Al + .'  ==&gt;  ' Li + Na '.\n\n\\**A 'j' particle has never been detected, although it could exist in theory;  likewise, there is a hypothetical 'q' particle that one would infer from the sequence of subatomic particles, but due to the laws of grammar it would only be able to form the element 'Qu';  when the so-called element 'Uuq' is actually discovered, if it exists, it will be called 'Qu' (rather than 'Uq') and allow us to make detailed measurements of the transitive energy of the shift particle for the first time.*\n\n---\n ^[edit: ^I ^wish ^to ^express ^my ^profound ^gratitude ^for ^the ^reddit ^gold.]","score":74,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

I understand that it seems insignificant, but it will become incredibly annoying the longer I have to do it.\n\n&gt;These are already posts that you were planning on deleting. How much work is it really going to be to flair them instead?\n\nThey'd even out. I'd have to go out to xkcd.com to see what comic number it is, then click the flair button, type in the comic number, and hit save. Alternatively, I would leave a comment informing them of the rule and remove it.\n\n&gt;Additionally a flair'd post has educational value. When submitters see that posts without comic numbers get flair'd they can notice and it can dawn on them that there post should include a comic number. The educational value of deleting a post is smaller - only the submitter will ever see that moderator action has been taken.\n\nBuuut, if a submitter goes to the frontpage and sees that all comic posts follow the \"xkcd ####:\" format, it will be even more obvious that he or she needs to submit with that format. Moreover, I can add the rule to the submission text. I think that's more obvious than flair.\n\n&gt;Again, we're seeing one or two posts a day on this subreddit. Based on that I'd take it further and say deleting ANY discussions on this subreddit will be harmful.\n\nBut, if I don't enforce the rule, then maybe half of the submissions will follow it, and that would defeat the purpose of having the rule (since users still would not be able to tell which comics are new and which are old). Deleting discussions hurts. I get it. I have to choose between the lesser of two evils here, (maybe) having to delete a few discussions early on to get the ball rolling, or abandon the rule. I think the second is the greater evil. *Hopefully* everyone will see the new rule and I won't have to remove anything.\n\n&gt;How many hours a day are you on Reddit? How quickly do you see things?\n\n&gt;Basicly this doesn't seem to me like something you as a single mod can constantly, timely keep on top of.\n\nI'm on about 4-5 hours daily. The first thing I check is this sub and its modqueue. I understand that I can't be on all the time to delete these posts. I'm going to try my best to catch them before they get too big.\n\n&gt;I think you're hurting the subreddit.\n\n&gt;Having comic numbers on threads would be nice. Deleting discussions on a small subreddit like this is horrible. I've suggested an alternative approach, I hope you'll consider it.\n\nWe'll see. I'll try my method for a week.

And don't be too confident as to whether you'll side with the progressists or the conservatives on it. Be cautious about thinking that the issues of the future will just recapitulate the issues of the past.\n\nThe robot rights issue will be more complex than we think, because when we have intelligent robots, we'll also be able to build an uninterupted continuum from the intelligent robots down to your vaccum. In fact it would make sense to equip most regular machines with some modest amount of intelligence so they can perform their task better. So where do we draw the line between which machines have rights and which don't?\n\nYou might think some measure of intelligence will have to be used for machines, but that wouldn't be fair since we don't use a similar definition for humans: people don't lose their basic rights for having brain-damage or for being in a coma. The robots could argue that if your brain-dead aunt has basic rights, then why wouldn't vaccum cleaners? \n\nEven if the continuum argument doesn't sway you, you should see that there is an ethical problem to a legal system where rights depend on a threshold that one group can control in the other. If a threshold X is chosen for AI rights, humans could just build machines that fall just short of the threshold or circumvent it in some way so that they can still have they intelligent-ish slaves. \n\nThis is a similar problem to those of a \"voter's test\" where voters need to prove sufficient knowledge in order to vote: it has the problem that the group who can vote can also control the non-voters' access to the knowledge that they would need to even start voting, and they can't vote this access for themselves since they can't pass the test. If humans have control over machines' access to intelligence level, then it's a problem to make intelligence level part of what makes machines have rights\n\nSo there is a possibility that the machine right issue will not just be about calling Data-like androids \"persons\" and letting them get married. There might be a point where our entire relationship with machines will need to be reconsidered. There might be a camp calling for the abolition of using machines as objects altogether. This is a radical view, but I think a very plausible one.\n\nThe issues of the future will not necessarily be as isomorphic to the ones of the past, and no one should presume that you'll always be on the progressive side of them.","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.\n\n&gt;It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.\n\n&gt;I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.\n\n&gt;Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.\n\n&gt;We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: \"November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.\"\n\n&gt;Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the \" Houston Center voice.\" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.\n\n&gt;Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. \"I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed.\" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. \"Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check\". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: \"Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.\"\n\n&gt;And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.\n\n&gt;Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: \"Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?\" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. \"Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.\"\n\n&gt;I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: \"Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.\"\n\n&gt;For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, \"Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.\"\n\n&gt;It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.\n\n&gt;For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.","score":44,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

If you held a shouting contest and asked a panel of trained judges to be as objective as possible and vote for the person they perceived as the loudest, you aren't going to get the most \"liked, admired, or supported\", you're going to get the person perceived to be the loudest.  But that is a bit of a contrived example, as many votes do boil down to popularity contests, and even in my example it could be argued that the judges are \"supporting the loudest\" so the winner could be considered \"popularly loud among judges\".\n\nIn my mind, votes can become less like popularity contests if you:\n\n* Give voters a specific criteria they should measure their choices by such as most influential book, book you found most entertaining, most informative, most factually sound, or give ratings from 1 to 10 on various specific categories.  This gets away from generic \"most liked\".\n* Find voters that are able to objectively measure the criteria such as a panel of judges, critics, limit to people that have read all the books, or frame the poll in a way that encourages objectivity.  This makes sure that judges aren't straying from the criteria and staying away from just defaulting to \"most liked\".\n\nAnyway, the fact that it was only a popularity contest was only one of my objections, and I accepted that they didn't really attempt to avoid that outcome.  My main objection is that we're intentionally distorting the audience away from a representative sample of goodreads readers and into an audience that is skewed towards reddit users.  If \"What If\" wins, it will no longer means that it is the most popular nonfiction book among goodreads because of our distortion.  Not that they've really made an attempt to properly sample their users, so they probably don't mind this kind of attention, since that is probably the reasons for polls like these.","score":8,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

The advantage of this hive is that the bees build honeycomb into [frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_frame), which can be moved with ease. The frames are designed to prevent bees from attaching [honeycombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycombs) where they would either connect adjacent frames, or connect frames to the walls of the hive. The movable frames allow the beekeeper to manage the bees in a way which was formerly impossible.\n\n&gt;Other inventors, notably [François Huber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Huber) in 1789, had designed hives with frames (the so-called *leafe* or book hive),  but Langstroth's hive was a practical movable frame hive, which overcame the tendency of the bees to fill empty spaces with comb and to cement smaller spaces together with [propolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propolis). In contrast to August von Berlepsch's frame-movable side-opened hive (May 1852, Germany), Langstroth's hive was top-opened, as was the Bevan [top-bar hive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-bar_hive) (1848, UK). These combined adaptations led to the Langstroth hive design being preferred by beekeepers over all others, and his hive is used throughout the world.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/TOraAjE.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Langstroth_Frames.jpg) - *A frame from a Langstroth hive \\(seen behind\\)*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Beekeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beekeeping) ^| [^Honey ^super](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_super) ^| [^Beehive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beehive) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+clkya5f) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+clkya5f)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","score":4,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

Since the circumference of a circle is 2\\*pi\\*r, there are 2pi radians in a circle. A square degree or square radian is just like a regular degree or radian, except instead of defining the circumference of a circle, it defines the surface area of a sphere.\n\nEverything is a radian away by definition. Everything is a different actual distance away, but if you place yourself in the center of a sphere the inside of which is painted with all the celestial bodies, then the \"distance\" between you and the edge of the sphere is 1 radian, regardless of how big this sphere is.\n\nI hope some of that made sense.","score":2,"subreddit":"xkcd"}

{"author":"OBOSOB","created_date":"2014-11-05 10:31:10","body":"&gt;\"That midterm figuratively killed me\" \n\nNo, however people would say things like \"that midterm killed me\" the figurative nature is implied because unless they just got resurrected, it didn't happen.\n\nNow, that is kind of fine if the statement is \"that midterm literally killed me\" because the same applies, it may make semantic pedants (guilty as charged) squirm but it does not impede understanding, it's clearly figurative due to context: they aren't dead.\n\nBut some people do say stuff \"I saw a massive spider and I *literally* shat myself\". Now we are dealing with either a delicate, embarrassing confession or, still more likely, they are figuratively exaggerating. So context, including social context and the type of language you expect of the speaker, should help here. Likelihood is they are using it figuratively, but then how *do* I make a literal statement and have it interpreted that way? Again, context is helpful but unambiguous language is clearer.\n\nWe're not all literally doomed by the loss of some amount of absolute expression but it is certainly not helpful to communication, especially in written form with someone we don't know, in some contexts. I'm sure better examples exist than my shitting oneself example. Formality is going to be a helpful contextual measure of course.\n\nI don't think you can dismiss the semantic challenge posed by a loss of clarity completely but it's important to not overstate it as many do.\n\nOverstatements will literally destroy communication irrecoverably.","score":1,"subreddit":"xkcd"}
